About corporate governance
H&M is a Swedish public limited company that is listed on Nasdaq Stockholm. H&M’s corporate governance – from shareholders, the board of directors and the CEO to the executive management team and country managers – is based on external laws, regulations and recommendations as well as internal rules.
The annual general meeting is H&M’s highest decision-making body. The nomination committee safeguards the shareholders’ interests and has a preparatory role ahead of the annual general meeting, including as regards motions on the composition of the board of directors.
The board of directors manages the company’s affairs on behalf of the shareholders. The board includes two employee representatives and two deputies for these, who are appointed by their respective employee organisations. H&M’s board of directors is led by the chairman of the board, Karl-Johan Persson. The board of directors appoints the CEO, who is responsible for the daily management of the company in accordance with instructions issued by the board.
The auditing committee monitors the company’s financial reporting and is the main channel of communication between the board and the company’s auditors. Each year the auditors report to the annual general meeting on their scrutiny.
The administration of the company by the board and CEO, and the financial reporting by the company, are reviewed by auditors appointed by the annual general meeting.
Managers and employees are guided by important internal documents such as the Code of Ethics, which also provides a basis for the strong values encapsulated in ‘the spirit of H&M’ – including common sense, continuous improvement, cost consciousness, salesmanship and belief in people.
Swedish Code of Corporate Governance
The Swedish Code of Corporate Governance is based on the principle of “comply or explain”, which means that companies applying the Code may deviate from individual rules provided they give an explanation of the deviation.
Among other things, the Code means that the company’s annual report must be supplemented with a separate report on corporate governance matters in which the company must state whether and how the Code was applied during the past financial year.

Board of Directors
The task of the board of directors is to manage the company’s affairs on behalf of the shareholders. The board members are elected by the shareholders at the annual general meeting for the period up to the end of the next AGM.
In addition to laws and recommendations, H&M’s board work is regulated by the board’s work plan which contains rules on the distribution of work between the board, its committees and the CEO, financial reporting, investments and financing. The work plan, which also includes a work plan for the audit committee, is established once a year. According to the articles of association, H&M’s board is to consist of at least three and no more than twelve members elected by the AGM and no more than the same number of deputies. The annual general meeting determines the exact number of board members.
H&M’s audit committee is appointed annually by the board of directors. The audit committee consists of Christian Sievert (chair) along with Anders Dahlvig (member) and Helena Saxon (member). The audit committee monitors the company’s financial reporting, which includes monitoring the effectiveness of the company’s internal control and risk management. Its work includes handling auditing issues and financial reports published by the company.

Board meetings
During the financial year H&M normally holds six regular board meetings, one of which is the statutory board meeting. Extraordinary board meetings are held when the need arises. The board consists of eight ordinary members elected by the annual general meeting. There are also three employee representatives and three deputy employee representatives. Eight members of the board are women and six are men; six of the fourteen are employed by the company. The board is assisted by a secretary who is not a member of the board.
The board meetings begin with a discussion of the company’s financial situation, with costs and sales as the main focus. The board goes through the various financial reports and the annual report and verifies these before they are published. The board meetings also discuss matters such as overall strategy, expansion and dividend policy.
The CEO attends meetings of the board in order to report on the operational work within the group and ensures that the board is given relevant and objective information on which to base its decisions.
Attendance at the board meetings is very good and the members participate in all discussions. Accounting matters are dealt with in detail within the auditing committee and reported back to the board.

Due diligence
To be a successful business we must act responsibly. Due diligence is a framework that ensures the way we operate safeguards people and planet.
How we work with due diligence
Due diligence is an ongoing process that enables us to identify and address impacts and risks in our own operations, our value chain, and the products or services we sell. These could be risks to the environment or to people, including human rights. For many years, it has supported our decision making and has been integral to operating a responsible business.
To be effective, due diligence requires collaboration and engagement with our rightsholders, stakeholders and business partners in a transparent and honest way. To tackle systemic issues at industry or national levels, we need to engage with other actors. In the long run, due diligence has the potential to bring about change for the most vulnerable people and communities.
Our due diligence process
We continuously carry out due diligence across our value chain following the process set out by the UNGP and OECD:
Embed responsible business conduct into policies and management systems.
We regularly update our standards and policies to ensure they remain valid and relevant.
Identify and assess adverse impacts in operations, supply chains and business relationships.
We use global and local procedures to continuously identify risks. Our teams located in production countries ensure we are up to date with local context and any changes. Our own employees, our business partners, plus employees working for suppliers in our value chain, can raise a grievance. 
Cease, prevent or mitigate adverse impacts.
Our strategies include using monitoring programs in our value chain, capacity-building programs, partnerships and multi-stakeholder initiatives.
Track implementation and results
We continuously track prioritised risks and impacts.
Communicate how impacts are addressed:
We have reported on our sustainability work since 2002 and publish all the reports on our website.
Provide for, or cooperate, in remediation where appropriate.
Through our whistleblower channel, Speak Up, people can raise concerns about our own operations as well as our value chain. We do not tolerate retaliation against anyone who, in good faith, reports a grievance or participates in a grievance investigation. We also encourage open and collaborative dialogue as a regular way of working. We cooperate with initiatives that provide other types of grievance mechanisms, such as the National Contact Points for Responsible Business. In addition, a Global Framework Agreement with IndustriAll and IF Metall is in place to assist in resolving grievances at our direct suppliers and their direct partners. If we have caused or contributed to adverse impacts, for example where harm has occurred, we either provide or cooperate with remediation, depending on how we are linked to the impact. Our Remediation Guideline directs which approach we take.
Throughout this process, we work closely with rightsholders and stakeholders to ensure our continuous analysis is inclusive and up to date.
Find out more about our approach to due diligence in our Responsible Business Conduct Due Diligence Policy, annual and sustainability report, salient human rights issues and Modern Slavery Statement.
A due diligence example – onboarding a new supplier
Our production supply chain includes hundreds of businesses around the world. When we take on a new supplier, due diligence helps us assess if they meet our environmental and social sustainability requirements.
All business partners must sign up to our Sustainability Commitment and our Code of Ethics.  When evaluating a new supplier, we share these minimum requirements early in the process to create a common understanding and ambition from the start. These requirements span issues such as working conditions, environmental practices and corruption. In terms of wage payments, we also review public information to check if any disputes have been registered. In some cases, we will reassess a supplier if they carry out actions to raise standards and meet our requirements within a given period of time.
Due diligence doesn’t stop once we have onboarded a supplier. We conduct regular reviews to assess continued compliance and performance. If we find a violation, we have a process in place to correct the issue. As a last resort, we have the right to pause business until the issue has been remedied. In some cases, we may need to cease the business relationship. If we take this decision, we abide by ACT’s Responsible Exit Policy.

Cotton
We are committed to keep improving the cotton we use in our products.
Cotton is a natural and renewable fibre widely used in clothing, home textiles and furniture. It counts for almost a quarter of global fibre production and represents 55% of the material used in our products.1 Cotton cultivation also provides employment and supports the livelihood of millions of people around the world.
At H&M Group, we use Textile Exchange’s definition of preferred cotton. This includes organic, in-conversion, recycled and regenerative cotton, as well as cotton sourced through organisations like Better Cotton.
In 2020, we reached our goal of sourcing all our cotton from preferred sources.2 Despite achieving this milestone, we will keep raising the bar on our requirements, exploring other cotton types and innovations.
We want to use our size and scale to create positive change. By collaborating with other stakeholders such as the Organic Cotton Accelerator, we can contribute to increasing sustainable farming practices and improving the livelihoods of farmers.
Recycled cotton
By 2030, we want to use only recycled or sustainably sourced materials in our products and for 50% of these to be recycled.2 Recycled cotton will play an important role in helping us achieve these goals. 
Recycled materials are a win-win; they stop waste material from going to landfill and reduce the use of virgin raw materials (as well as chemicals, energy and water used to make them).
Recycled cotton is made from textile remnants from production, or from post-consumer textile waste from collected garments. These are mechanically recycled, shredded into fibres, spun into new yarns and made into new fabrics. For manmade cellulosic fibres like lyocell and viscose, cotton is recycled through a chemical process. 
Currently, there are challenges in sorting and separation as well as maintaining fibre length, which may limit how the recycled fibre can be used. We are looking for solutions to these obstacles by collaborating with innovators, building our supply chain’s capacities in sorting, collecting and managing pre-consumer fibre waste, as well as re-engineering our products to include more recycled cotton content.
Better Cotton
Better Cotton is a non-profit organisation helping cotton growers convert to farming practices that offer longer lasting economic, environmental and social benefits, both at farm level and in their local communities. In the 2020-21 growing season, Better Cotton worked with 2.9 million farmers in 26 countries, equal to 20% of the world’s cotton production.
Organic cotton
Because organic cotton farming doesn’t use chemical pesticides and insecticides, it improves soil condition, lowers greenhouse gas emissions, strengthens biodiversity and improves cotton growers’ health. It also has socio-economic benefits. Farming organically costs less and farmers can generate additional income from other crops they grow alongside organic cotton plants.
We’ve used organic cotton in our collections since 1990s, as do many other brands today. To help increase global production, we are a founding member of an industry initiative called the Organic Cotton Accelerator (OCA). The OCA aims to further strengthen the supply, demand and integrity of organic cotton.
In-conversion cotton
Demand for organic cotton has boomed in recent years. We welcome this development, but it means it is not possible to source the amount we need for our collections. To encourage and support more farmers to transition to organic farming, we will start using cotton from farms that are in the process of converting. This is called in-conversion cotton.
On average it takes three years for a farm to convert to organic cultivation. During this time the farm follows the principals of organic farming – no pesticides or synthetic fertilisers – and is independently audited each year. The only difference is that the crop is not yet certified organic.
By buying in-conversion cotton, we will help scale up organic production and support farmers in making the transition to organic cultivation.
Regenerative cotton
One of the focus areas of our cotton sourcing is to scale regenerative farming practices in cotton production. We have invested in several projects in India that will support thousands of farmers. These projects aim to improve soil health, which will restore and enhance biodiversity, as well as help farmers become climate resilient, among other things. We will place our first orders for regenerative cotton in 2023.

Designing for circularity
We believe in a circular future driven by style and design.
What is designing for circularity? 
In a world with finite resources, we need to change the way we make everything, including fashion. For many years, we aimed to use the most sustainable materials to make the most desirable pieces. Now we need to broaden our focus and consider what happens to products beyond the drawing board.   
We follow Ellen MacArthur Foundation’s vision for a circular fashion industry and aim to design products to be: 
Used more 
Made to be made again 
Made from safe, recycled or renewable inputs 
Our approach 
By considering a product’s entire lifespan and making better decisions at the design stage, we can reduce our impact on climate, water, nature and people.
We also need to make full use of the energy and materials embedded in our clothes. The best way to do this is to design products according to their purpose, using them for as long as possible, then repairing, reselling and repurposing them, before they are recycled at the end of their life.
What is product purpose?
To guide design decisions and choice of materials or processes, it’s crucial to consider a product’s purpose. Thinking about how the product will be used and its expected lifespan makes sure we use the right amount of resources. This can also be known as designing for intended use or intended function.
Product purpose also deals with trade-offs between things like durability and recyclability. Durable products are tricky to recycle because they often need extra stitching or blended materials. At the same time, easy to recycle products made of mono-fibres can’t always deliver the same performance, functionality or durability as blended-fibres.
Find out more about how we work with product purpose in our Circulator Guide.
What are we doing at H&M Group? 
There have been many developments since we started out on our circular design journey. Firstly, we have learnt a lot, but upcoming legislation such as the EcoDesign for Sustainable Product Regulation is perhaps the biggest. Our current focus is on preparing for these new laws, while remaining committed to a long term vision to create products fit for a circular economy. These are some of the highlights of what we’ve achieved so far:
The Circulator
A team of internal and external experts have been reimagining our approach to design. The result is Circulator – a guide that offers support through the product development process to maximise the circular potential of a product. In 2021 we produced the first version of the Circulator to to share our ideas with other brands, designers and people interested in circular fashion. In 2023, we updated the guide, refining our approach and reflecting what we had learnt. Download Circulator here.
Circular Design Consortium
We are a member of the Circular Design Consortium alongside other fashion brands. Together, we collaborate with industry peers to share learnings and address shared challenges around circular design . Currently the consortium is determining its future scope.
Weekday jeans
Between 2019 and 2023, Weekday were part of the Ellen MacArthur Foundation’s Jeans Redesign Project, applying circular design principles to their denim collections. They started with two styles and gradually added more each season. Read more in this case study. Even though the project is over, Weekday continue to use the principles in their jean’s development process.

Content:
Leather
We are committed to responsible leather sourcing for our products.
The challenge
Leather is known for its durability and longevity. We use it in shoes, bags, accessories and clothing. It only makes up 0.1% of the materials we source, but it has significant environmental and social impacts. This is why we prioritise improving our sourcing of this material.
While we only accept leather from animals that have been bred for meat production, cattle farming produces greenhouse gas emissions and can lead to deforestation. There are also concerns about animal welfare. Tanning and finishing leather uses hazardous chemicals and causes pollution. While labour rights and working conditions are a concern across the supply chain.
Our approach
We are committed to improving our leather sourcing and to contribute to reducing these negative impacts. Leather is covered in our animal welfare policy, and we work with partners to address issues such as deforestation, transparency and traceability, and human rights. See more information in the list of projects below.
In 2024, 89 % of our leather products were produced with chrome free tanning, such as vegetable tanned leather and metal-free leather, and we are aiming for 100% by 2025. By 2030, we aim to source all our leather from farms with good animal welfare practices and that are deforestation and conversion free.*
Projects and actions
Leather Working Group
We are a member of the Leather Working Group, a multi-stakeholder community committed to building a more responsible leather industry. It sets standards for the leather manufacturing process, using different criteria including environmental and social sustainability, chemicals, and traceability. All leather used by our brands must be sourced from LWG certified tanneries
Deforestation-Free Call to Action for leather
We have signed the Deforestation-Free Call to Action for Leather, co-led by Textile Exchange, LWG and WWF, which aims to spur action towards ending deforestation in the leather supply chain by 2030 or earlier. By signing, we commit to source all our bovine leather from supply chains that do not cause deforestation or conversion of natural ecosystems. Our target is to achieve this by 2030 at the latest.
Leather Impact Accelerator
In 2023, we were one of several brands who supported Textile Exchange’s Leather Impact Accelerator (LIA) Impact Incentives pilot. This tool is part of the LIA and rewards farmers who follow best practices. Through the pilot, we bought incentives that financially supported a program partner to help cattle farmers in Brazil become independently verified as deforestation and conversion free and certified to an LIA-approved animal welfare standard within a three-year period. Our three-year commitment to purchasing Impact Incentives began in 2021.
Textile Exchange’s Leather Round table
We are part of Textile Exchange’s Leather Round Table, which brings together stakeholders from across the leather and other relevant industries. This roundtable focuses on some of the biggest issues in the sector including better animal welfare, fair treatment of workers and reducing greenhouse gas emissions.
* Definition based on the Accountability Framework Initiative’s definition of deforestation and degradation.
We publish our sustainability progress report annually. In this document, we set out our goals and the progress we’ve made in the previous year. Find the latest version here. More up to date information can be included on this webpage.

Our history
Our founder had a vision. Erling Persson wanted to make great fashion available and affordable to everyone and do this in the right way. From a single store in 1947 we became a family of brands offering fashion and design to customers worldwide. This is our story.
’40S-’50S
’60S-’70S
’80S-’90S
’00S-’10S
’20S-
The ’40s and ’50s
1947
Inspired by his trip to New York City the year before, Swedish entrepreneur Erling Persson opens a new womenswear store in Västerås, Sweden. He calls it Hennes, Swedish for “Hers”. The soon-to-be-famous Hennes logotype is designed by the founder himself.
1952
The first Hennes store opens in Sweden’s capital, Stockholm.
1954
Hennes takes out a full-page colour ad in Sweden’s largest daily, a pioneering belief in the power of marketing.
Inside the first Hennes store in Västerås, Sweden
The ’60s and ’70s
1968
Hennes acquires the Stockholm-based hunting apparel and fishing equipment retailer Mauritz Widforss, and the name is changed to Hennes & Mauritz. The stores start offering men’s and children’s clothing, covering fashion needs for the entire family.
1969
The expansion is rapid: Hennes & Mauritz has 42 stores.
During these decades, the international growth begins. Norway comes first, followed by Denmark, the UK, and Switzerland.
The growth pace increases even further, with five or six new stores opening every year. 
  1973
– Hennes & Mauritz starts selling underwear.
– ABBA-member Anni-Frid Lyngstad becomes the first “supermodel” to be photographed for the company.
1974
– Hennes & Mauritz is listed on the Stockholm Stock Exchange.
– The stores are rebranded with the abbreviation “H&M”.
1977

Code of Ethics
At H&M Group, we make it a rule to act with integrity at all times. Our business principles commit us to comply with all rules and regulations in each country where we operate and do not accept any form of corruption.
We implement this commitment through our Code of Ethics, which has been in place since 2003. The Code of Ethics states a zero tolerance policy on corruption and demands compliance with all relevant laws and our own business principles. It states, among other things, that business partners should not provide any kind of gifts or favours to H&M Group employees. In the same way, H&M Group employees must not ask for or accept any personal advantage from a business partner.
All our business units are regularly assessed as regards the risks of corruption. Based on this risk assessment, the Code applies to all business partners and all H&M Group employees who are in regular contact with these. All colleagues working in our offices around the world, as well as store management, and all our business partners must sign the Code of Ethics and commit to comply.
We make all our business partners and relevant employees aware of the Code and we provide the information and training necessary to understand and comply with it. All suppliers must sign the Code before they can be accepted by H&M Group. We inform all new employees of the Code during the recruitment process.
Corruption
Corruption is a challenge in many of the markets where we operate. We have a zero tolerance policy and take a proactive approach in preventing corruption. This is described in our Code of Ethics, which applies to all of our business partners, not only suppliers, and of course all our 179,000 colleagues around the world.
We conduct regular corruption risk assessments and, rather than aiming at zero cases on paper, our goal is to actually find the cases where our Code of Ethics has been violated. We see education and building awareness as crucial tools in preventing corruption, especially in high-risk countries. Our Code of Ethics – provides a clear backbone to our business, ranging from our clear commitment to legal compliance in the countries in which we operate to not accepting or facilitating any form of corruption with a clear no-gift policy.
Our tax policy always reflects our business and we are tax compliant at all times. All taxes and fees are paid at the appropriate time and according to local laws and regulations in the countries where we operate. The company’s tax rate depends on the results of our entities and the corporate tax rates in each country.
H&M Group provides a secure Speak-Up channel, to our employees, business partners and third parties to inform us of suspected of Code of Ethics violations. All reports will be investigated and appropriate actions taken.

§2 The object of the enterprise is, directly or indirectly,
– to trade in textiles and ready-to-wear clothing, shoes, accessories, cosmetics, watches, pens, accessories for the home – principally textiles and other similar goods;
– to trade in groceries and to conduct café and restaurant operations;

Shares of two classes may be issued: series A and series B. Shares of series A may be issued up to a maximum number of 288,000,000 and shares of series B up to a maximum of 2,016,000,000.
§5 The company’s shares shall consist of both series A shares and series B shares. Series A shares are entitled to ten votes and series B shares to one vote. In other respects series B shares shall be equal to series A shares.
§6 If the company resolves to issue new shares of two classes, series A and series B, through a cash issue or offset issue, holders of series A and series B shares shall have a preferential right to subscribe for new shares of the same class in proportion to the number of shares already owned by the shareholders (primary preferential right). Shares not subscribed for on the basis of a primary preferential right shall be offered for subscription to all shareholders (subsidiary preferential right). If the number of shares offered in this way is insufficient to meet the demand from holders of a subsidiary preferential right, the shares shall be allocated among the subscribers in proportion to the number of shares already held by them and, to the extent that this is not possible, through the drawing of lots.
If the company resolves to issue new shares of only one class through a cash issue or an offset issue, all shareholders, irrespective of the class of share they hold, shall have a preferential right of subscription to the new shares in proportion to the number of shares already held by them.
If the company decides to issue warrants or convertibles through a cash issue or an offset issue, the shareholders shall have a preferential right to subscribe for warrants as if the issue concerned the shares which may be subscribed for on the basis of the options, or a preferential right to subscribe for convertibles as if the issue concerned the shares for which the convertibles may be exchanged.
The above provisions shall not restrict the company’s right to resolve on a cash issue or an offset issue which is not based on shareholders’ preferential rights.
If the share capital is increased through a bonus issue, new shares of each class will be issued in proportion to the number of shares of the same class as already exist.
Earlier shares of a specific class shall then entitle the shareholder to new shares of the same class. The foregoing shall not restrict the company’s right to issue shares of a new class through a bonus issue, following the requisite amendments to the articles of association.
§7 The board of directors appointed by the general meeting shall have no fewer than three and no more than twelve members, with no more than the same number of deputy members.

Waste
We are committed to reducing waste across our own operations and supply chain. Where we do generate waste, we want as much as possible to be collected, sorted, and recycled.
The challenge
Waste is a significant global issue, with far-reaching implications for our environment and for people. Addressing it requires systemic solutions.
Our own operations and supply chain generate several types of waste, from product and packaging waste, to textile offcuts in the supply chain. If not managed properly, it can end up in places where it shouldn’t and harm the environment.
Customers need reliable systems to safely dispose of packaging or products. This means improving global waste management infrastructure, including better sorting and recycling technology. To build a system that works, companies, policy makers, recyclers and other stakeholders need to work together.
Our approach
In line with our environmental policy, we want to generate as little waste as possible. We also want to increase the share of waste that is reused or recycled and for no waste to end up in landfills,.
We are guided by the Ellen MacArthur Foundation’s circular economy principles and the European Union’s Waste Management Hierarchy. We prioritise actions towards the top of the pyramid, prioritising prevention and reuse before recycling.
To prevent and reduce waste, we design for durability and recyclability, align production with demand, use recycled materials and offer customers ways to prolong the life of their garments.
EUROPEAN UNION’S WASTE MANAGEMENT HIERARCHY
When we do generate waste, we treat it as a resource. We work with our partners to improve material collection, sorting, recycling and circulation. Through our joint venture, Looper Textile Co., we are improving textile sorting in Europe. As a founding partner of Syre, we are extending the life of used textiles and helping to increase the availability of textile-to-textile recycled polyester – a better alternative to PET-recycled polyester. Our garment collecting programme also helps to increase the reuse and recycling of textile waste.
We work with peers, experts and policy makers to encourage collective action and effective legislation. Advocating for policies that support an effective circular economy helps us achieve our goals for circularity and recycled materials.
Prioritised waste streams
Our waste management strategy focuses on product and packaging waste in our own operations, textiles collected from our customers, and textile cutting waste from product manufacturing.
Waste from our operations1
In our own operations, most waste comes from products that are returned as damaged or faulty, those damaged during transport or with a production fault, and from packaging.
We are removing unnecessary packaging, and reducing its size and weight. We are also replacing plastic with paper or cardboard to improve recyclability and increase packaging recycling rates.
Our priority is always to reuse products before recycling. If damaged or recalled products cannot be sold through our own channels or via partners, such as outlets, we prioritise donating them to charities. We may also sell them to sorting partners.
For some items, reuse or recycling is not always possible. There may be inadequate waste handling infrastructure or recycling technology for the product type, for example beauty products or ceramics. In cases where products are contaminated or considered harmful, we prioritise incineration for energy recovery.
Textile cutting waste in the supply chain
Textile cutting waste generated during production is a valuable resource. Our suppliers follow guidelines to ensure this waste is recovered and recycled where possible. We are also building a network of recyclers using the digital platform, Reverse Resources.
Textiles collected from customers
We were one of the first brands to launch a garment collecting programme in 2013 and since then we have received over 172,700 tonnes of textiles from customers. In early 2023, we launched Looper Textile Co., an independent joint venture with Remondis that provides local municipalities and retailers with solutions to extend the useful life of unwanted garments via reuse and recycling. We encourage our partners to sort products according to their condition, in line with the EU waste hierarchy, which prioritises reuse before recycling.
We have been collecting used textiles from our customers for over a decade. In 2024, customers dropped off over 17,000 tonnes of textiles at our collection points. We work with our partners to bring these products and materials back into the supply chain for reuse or recycling. This extends their life and reduces the amount of textile waste discarded in household waste.
1 Products discarded in our own operations (in stores or in distribution centres) are included here.. This includes textile products – garment and home –, accessories, hardware products, beauty and chemical (e.g. candles) products.
We publish our sustainability progress report annually. In this document, we set out our goals and the progress we’ve made in the previous year. Find the latest version here. More up to date information can be included on this page.

Responsible purchasing practices
At H&M Group we are committed to developing responsible purchasing practices that ensure we are a fair business partner. Our purchasing practices should support the textile and garment industry to develop in a sustainable way and offer long-term improvements to garment workers and suppliers.
H&M Group – a fashion buyer
Most fashion brands do not make fashion, they are fashion buyers. It’s the same for H&M Group – we design in-house, but we have outsourced production ever since the company was created in 1947. This means we are customers to locally owned or multi-national garment manufacturers based mainly in Asia and Europe. When we choose to buy from these manufacturers we invest in their workforce, enable local employment opportunities, and support local and national institutions to develop resilient economies and social protection systems.
The factories are not owned nor managed by us, but by independent businessmen and women. Some employ less than ten people while the largest employ tens of thousands of people, the majority of whom are women. We share suppliers with many other fashion and sports brands. 
  Signing the ACT commitment on purchasing practices
Research and our own experience shows that even though we do not own factories, our buying behaviour and standards can influence conditions and practices at our suppliers. We want to have a positive impact on our business partners, which is why we are a founding member of ACT – Action, Collaboration and Transformation, alongside 18 other brands and the global union IndustriALL. Created in 2014, ACT sets out five commitments for responsible purchasing. We have signed up to all of them:
Purchasing prices include wages as itemised costs. 
Fair terms of payments. 
Better planning and forecasting. 
Undertake training on responsible sourcing and buying. 
Practice responsible exit strategies.
These commitments help us to design and continually improve our purchasing practices. 
Responsible purchasing practices at H&M Group
We have a strong local presence in our main sourcing markets, which means we can build genuine partnerships with our suppliers and collaborate closely with them each day. This is a crucial part of being a responsible buyer. For example, we have our own production offices in Dhaka in Bangladesh and in Shanghai in China. By being close to our suppliers we have developed partnerships built on mutual trust and transparency. This is a crucial part of being a responsible buyer.
Most of our purchasing practices are governed by digital systems and company policies. This ensures we consistently implement our standards and limits the risk of human error or external influence. It also means that many of the commitments we make, like adhering to certain payment terms, occur automatically.
Building relationships
Since 2011, we have used a supplier relationship management system. It helps us to evaluate and develop our suppliers across several business and sustainability parameters. We reward responsible and high-performing suppliers by providing production plans well in advance. This allows factories to plan for, and better manage, peaks and troughs in demand. For our strategic suppliers, we plan our order capacity as far as three to five years ahead, which gives them the stability to invest in their facility and workforce.
Wages as an itemised cost
What we pay suppliers for a garment is split into different cost blocks such as material, labour and operations. As part of our standard buying approach, we calculate labour costs together with our suppliers using a method that takes into consideration production time, efficiency and wages of workers, among other things. When wages increase, for example through an increase in local minimum wage levels or collective bargaining agreements, the labour cost is automatically recalculated and adjusted. This process increases transparency and ensures labour costs are not part of price negotiations. Ring-fencing labour costs in this way ensures wage improvements are reflected in the prices we pay our suppliers. 
Payment terms
Payment terms can impact suppliers’ financial resilience and ability to invest. We have agreed on standardised payment terms with our suppliers, which are in line with industry averages. In addition, H&M Group has negotiated a factoring agreement on behalf of all its suppliers that gives them faster access to invoice payments. Suppliers can opt to receive payment approximately three days after sending an invoice. Taking this into account, our suppliers get paid on average 32 days after the invoice issue date.
Exiting a supplier relationship
Sometimes we need to end a business relationship with a supplier. For example, a supplier may be phased out if our capacity or capability needs change, the supplier fails to meet our compliance or sustainability requirements, or due to poor quality performance. Whatever the reason, we want to minimise the negative impact of exiting a business relationship. 
We do this by following the ACT Responsible Exit Policy. This policy sets out a clear phase-out process during which we conduct a worker impact assessment and create an exit plan in close dialogue with the supplier. We also inform all relevant stakeholders, in particular trade unions or other labour organisations that represent workers in the facility. To limit negative impact, the phase out process takes between six months to 1.5 years, and we monitor and communicate each step verbally and in writing.
Developing our purchasing practices
There are still many challenges we need to address to make sure our purchasing practices do not contribute to any human rights violations on the factory floor. To help develop and improve our practices, we ask our suppliers how they perceive us as a buyer in anonymous surveys. In 2024, 92% of our suppliers said that we are a fair business partner.
We also complete a biannual industrywide assessment on purchasing practices with our suppliers as part of ACT’s Accountability and Monitoring Framework. In both 2021 and 2023, our suppliers rated our practices in all areas either above or on par with the survey average. We improved in nine of the 16 areas, such as forecasting and capacity planning, sales and transparency, and price quotations. However, there is still work to be done, particularly in areas like changes to orders, and production and lead time.
  We are committed to continuously develop our purchasing practices in all areas. As part of this drive, we have trained more than 660 H&M Group employees in responsible purchasing practices since 2022, covering over 78% of key roles.
Why are responsible purchasing practices important?
Responsible purchasing practices support the fair treatment of garment workers, wage improvements and provide a healthy work environment. It is difficult for suppliers to be good employers if the companies that buy from them are not committed to responsible purchasing practices.
Key questions to find out if you are a responsible buyer include: will the supplier be paid within the agreed timeframe for the goods produced? What will the price be and what parameters will the price be negotiated on? What is the process for forecasting and placing orders and how is this communicated with suppliers? What are the cancellation terms and how are they regulated in contracts?
For example, the fashion industry is generally seasonally dependent. Customers buy seasonal products when they need them; swimwear in spring and knitwear in winter. This creates an irregular buying and production pattern with peaks and troughs. Good purchasing practices and supplier relationships help to address the challenges related to uneven production. For example, if buyers work with suppliers to plan capacity well in advance, it reduces excessive overtime for factory workers in peak seasons and helps plan for periods with less customer demand.
Buyers are responsible for creating an environment in which working conditions and human rights can be properly respected and implemented. For example, if a buyer pays for products ordered on time, then suppliers can pay their workers on time.
Adequate planning and responsible purchasing practices also reduce the risk of overtime, late wage payments, and health and safety violations. As well as helping to create a healthy work environment and good conditions in the factories.

Towards a more inclusive business
We work to continuously improve our customer offering and experience and have an explicit focus on making these more inclusive and diverse.
Inclusion and diversity through all our brands
While our brands have unique identities, they are all united in their goals to be relevant, inclusive and diverse to current and future customers. To facilitate this, we equip our brands with the tools, information, education and support to help mitigate bias, improve inclusion and promote diversity in all customer-facing activities – from design ideas and product development to marketing and communication across our sales channels.
Internally, we offer trainings – on cultural appropriation and representation, as well as on legal and ethical aspects of product development, to name a couple – while our advertising and product policies guide our teams in naming and designing products, prints and graphics. Our internal teams continue to create content to serve local market needs, including better representations of the local customer, size inclusivity, more racial/ethnic diversity and unique local products. We also began trialling new approaches to better cater to our non-binary customers and improve their in-store experience, as part of our mission to reflect, respect and relate to our customers and communities.

Analysis and results
To identify and prioritise sustainability matters along our value chain that are most relevant to our business, we analyse inputs from our stakeholders and investors in a materiality analysis. We start our yearly materiality analysis process by identifying possible impact areas as part of our overall risk management process, using a wide range of sources, including OECD sector risks, topical ESRS, GRI standards, and a systematic analysis of stakeholder inputs and expectations. Identified matters are assessed and prioritised at the end of the year by our subject matter experts. The process is coordinated by the sustainability department, responsible for ensuring consistency and alignment of the methodologies and assumptions used, and includes the:
Identification of relevant sustainability impact areas along our value chain through continuous dialogue with our key stakeholders and international organisations such as ILO, OECD, international trade unions, human rights organisations, and policymakers during the year. 
Assessment and prioritisation of relevant sustainability impact areas based on the severity and likelihood of the impact. Severity is calculated as the average between the scale, scope and irremediable character of the impact. The assessment of our sustainability impact is closely connected to our overall risk management process, to ensure these processes are aligned. The threshold for impact materiality is based on the inherent impact level. 
Monitoring and reporting prioritised sustainability matters. Relevant matters are categorised and listed in our overall risk management system along with their associated mitigation plans and actions, and are monitored during the year to follow up on the effectiveness of our actions. Our prioritised matters form the basis of our sustainability strategy and reporting, see the table below for the results of the impact materiality analysis for 2024.

Content:
Our approach to respecting human rights
H&M Group’s ambition is to lead our industry to a more sustainable and responsible future. Our commitment to respecting human rights underpins this ambition and is reflected in our policies and roadmaps, supported by our culture and governance structure.
We conduct due diligence to identify risks to people, and work to prevent and mitigate any harm, as well as to ensure there are channels for people to raise concerns and access remedy. By being transparent with our ambitions and learnings through public reporting and communication we hope to inspire action and drive collaboration.
To operate with respect to human rights is an ongoing journey and we still have a lot to learn, but we know we have the experience, opportunity and determination to make a difference.
Our Commitment
Our commitment includes all internationally recognised human rights stated in the International Bill of Human Rights and the International Labour Organization’s Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work. We also acknowledge children’s and women’s rights as outlined in the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child and the United Nations Convention on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women.
Governance and integration
Policy integration: Our commitment to operating with respect for international standards is manifested in our corporate-level Human Rights Policy and reflected in operational-level policies and guidelines, which help us act with accountability and fulfill our obligations in practice.
Key operational-level policies include our Sustainability Commitment, which sets out our requirements for suppliers and business partners to respect human rights and the environment and to ensure good working conditions, our global Social Policies, which are the equivalent for our internal operations, and our Material Ethics policy.
Guidelines to further support our teams and business partners in how to respect human rights in their daily work include our Migrant Worker Guideline to secure fair recruitment of migrant workers, and our Responsible AI Framework, which is applied when developing new AI applications.
Governance and culture:  Responsibility for implementation of our commitment to operate with respect to human rights is delegated to senior operational executives who report to our CEO. The Head of Sustainability and Head of Corporate Governance oversee the overall implementation and report on progress and impact to the Board of Directors and the leadership team on a regular basis. The work to develop reporting and steering to further integrate human-rights management in an effective and meaningful way is ongoing.
One of H&M Group’s core values is “believe in people”; a key aspect of our corporate governance has, and will always be, that we trust our colleagues to make the right decisions. Raising awareness and ensuring that respect for human rights is embedded in our culture and values means providing colleagues with appropriate training and the right tools.
Training and awareness raising: Awareness raising and sense-making of what it means to operate with respect to human rights is key to effective integration. We provide basic human-rights training across our business, tailoring content for different functions and roles. Training includes a basic introduction to human rights, an outline of our responsibilities in line with the UNGPs, and key aspects of effective implementation. In-depth training and workshops are targeted at key staff and cover specific topics such as forced labour and application of remedy logic. A similar approach is being applied to suppliers and business partners.
Human-rights due diligence
We conduct human-rights due diligence across our value chain, adjusted to operational context and risk, business relationships, and the nature of our involvement with an impact. Our process is continuous and develops as we incorporate learnings and input from stakeholders and experts.
Identifying risk to people: Our efforts are focused on our salient human rights issues. These are the issues which have the most severe negative impact on people across our value chain. They include wages, child labor, forced labor, modern slavery, and rights to water. We regularly review our salient human rights issues together with internal and external stakeholders to ensure their relevance and to define prioritized efforts and engagement.
Special attention is given to vulnerable groups of people that are more exposed to violations, including women, children and migrant workers.
Risk and impact assessment: We conduct human-rights risk assessments across our value chain to identify risk to people, including but not limited to, new markets, suppliers and materials. As a global business, with a retail and production presence in over 80 markets it is not effective nor impactful to apply the same approach everywhere. That’s why we apply a risk-based approach to our due diligence.
We target high-risk regions, functions or processes that require the closest attention. We also seek to extend our reach by focusing on supplier ownership and partnership. This means cascading responsibilities and building leverage via our business partners to capture and address potential and actual human rights issues throughout our supply chain. 
Acting on identified risks: Our approach to preventing and mitigating issues is adjusted to operational context and risk, business relationships and the nature of our involvement with an impact. Strategies include labour-monitoring programs across our manufacturing supply chain, training and outreach programs, communication of policies, establishment of grievance channels, capacity-building programs, partnerships, and multi-stakeholder initiatives. We strive to continuously incorporate learnings and invite stakeholders to provide feedback on our efforts.
In many markets where we operate, certain human-rights issues are systemic. Tackling these requires collaboration with other actors and we encourage collective efforts with peers, business partners, governments and non-governmental organisations. Our work on wages is an example of an issue that is systemic and requires action from different actors.
We also engage in public affairs with the aim to strengthen regulatory effectiveness and the role of governments in protecting human rights in countries where we operate.
Stakeholder engagement: Throughout the process, we strive to engage with rights holders (colleagues, workers in our supply chain, customers, and communities) or their relevant representatives such as unions or NGOs, to receive valuable input. We continuously invite stakeholders to provide feedback on our efforts so we can further improve our strategies and programmes.
For systemic issues or those further upstream in our supply chain, where our influence is limited, we join forces with a broader range of stakeholders such as our peers, suppliers and business partners, NGOs and expert organisations to collaboratively address and improve the sustainability of our industry.
Reporting and communication: Reporting on risks and outcomes is done both to inform decision-making and to evaluate and adjust our approach for effectiveness. Human-rights reporting is one aspect of our corporate governance, where we work to establish meaningful reporting that drives positive outcomes for people and connects with business value.
We communicate and report on progress and challenges through various channels, including our annual Sustainability Report. Over the years we have built strong business relationships with our manufacturing suppliers and were one of the first brands to make our supplier list public in 2013.
We strongly believe transparency and partnership increase accountability and drive progress. Over the years our efforts to integrate human-rights management and eradicate modern slavery from our supply chains have been recognised by the Corporate Human Rights Benchmark and the Know the Chain benchmark.
Grievance mechanisms and incident management
Despite the best intentions and efforts, incidents and grievances will occur across our value chain.  We are committed to building a culture of trust and openness, and to ensuring effective grievance mechanisms are in place for people to raise issues and access remedy.
These mechanisms are an important aspect of our ongoing human-rights due diligence and our strategic focus on promoting workers’ voices and well-functioning industrial relations in our markets. We believe the most effective way to ensure respect for human rights and good working conditions is to enable and empower individuals to speak up.
Grievance mechanisms. Our ambition is for grievances to be managed as close to the issue as possible. We do not tolerate retaliation against anyone who, in good faith, reports a grievance or participates in the investigation of a grievance in our own operations or across our supply chain.
Our internal Grievance Policy aims to ensure that all employees within H&M Group have a channel for putting forward grievances as well as access to an efficient procedure for the handling of violations or grievances related to our social policies. This includes providing a supportive and open atmosphere where employees feel comfortable bringing up issues directly with their managers or peers, as well as providing a company-level channel where colleagues can escalate issues. Similarly our corporate Speak-up! channel allows eligible stakeholders to raise grievances or concerns related to human rights impacts connected to activities across our full value chain. 
Our requirements on our suppliers and business partners include the establishment of operational-level grievance mechanisms. We also recognise the importance of human-rights defenders, including union representatives, in bringing attention to issues. We expect our suppliers and business partners to not hinder the work of human-rights defenders or retaliate against anyone who comes forward with an issue.
For our manufacturing supply chain, we follow up on the presence of effective operational-level grievance channels via our monitoring programs. One of the strategic focus areas within our social sustainability work is to strengthen workers’ voices. We encourage and support the establishment of democratically elected worker representatives, and we work with our suppliers and unions to support good industrial relations.
In key production markets, and as part of our framework agreement with global union federation IndustriALL and IF Metall, we have established National Monitoring Committees (NMC) in collaboration with local union representatives to, amongst other things, receive grievances and support in resolving issues that have been escalated.
Incident management. For situations that impact on human rights we apply a systematic approach to analysing each case and supporting its resolution, as well as to informing our involvement in providing remedy using the UNGPs enabling remedy framework. We recognise our responsibility to provide for remedy when impacts are connected to our activities, as well as our role in exercising influence through our business relationships and building leverage with others for issues further up our supply chains where we don’t have direct business relationships. This specific analysis of human-rights impacts is integrated into our existing routine for handling cases and incidents, and we work to raise awareness among colleagues involved in grievance and incident management.
Identified human-rights incidents at supplier factories are handled in line with our incident-management processes, including issuing Letters of Concern in response to severe non-compliances with our Sustainability Commitment. To prevent re-occurrence, we have ongoing monitoring programs in place to assess progress, incentivise suppliers that share our ambition for responsible and sustainable business practices through more business, and encourage engagement in various programs at local and global levels.

Circular business models
We need to scale alternative ways of doing business to make sure our products are used more and we recover the materials they are made from when they are no longer usable. This way, we can move away from relying on virgin natural resources to grow our business. 
Why are we introducing circular business models?
We need to take responsibility for the impact fashion has on climate and the environment. Circular business models (CBMs) can help us reduce and limit this negative impact by moving away from using an increasing amount of resources to grow, while continuing to deliver fashion and style for our customers. 
Customer
Our customers’ needs and expectations are changing. Research shows that circular business models are growing up to ten times faster than the traditional fashion market, with generation Z driving the shift. They are motivated by getting more for their money, finding fashion one-offs and a desire to shop more sustainably.
What are circular business models?
Traditionally, fashion has followed a linear business model – take, make, waste. CBMs break this chain to keep garments in use for longer through care and repair services and by increasing the number of users through resell and rental. Once they have come to the end of their useful lifespan, collection schemes make sure they are not wasted and help maximise the value of the resources that went into making them.
Our customer facing circular business models
Across the H&M Group, we are trialing different types of circular business models to give our customers new ways to experience and engage in circular fashion and choose more sustainable options. These models help us learn what works and what doesn’t so we can scale up services that meet our customers’ needs. They fall into four broad categories – access, use and care, repair and collect. 
RESELL
USE AND CARE
REPAIR
COLLECT
Resell
Offering customers a different way to enjoy and experience fashion, while keeping products in use for as long as possible.
Direct online resell
Customers in Sweden and Germany can shop secondhand items online alongside H&M’s current collection.
Partner online resell
Through ThredUp customers can buy secondhand H&M in US, plus secondhand COS in Germany and UK. ARKET is working with Archive Resale in UK and Sweden.
Sellpy
Customers can purchase secondhand through Sellpy and H&M in 24 markets, and can sell in eight markets.
Trial and scale
We need to trial different services to find the ones that work best for us and our customers. Then we need to scale them. If these new models are going to help us reach our climate and biodiversity goals, they need to grow  into being part of our core business.  
We’ve already learnt a lot about resale. To make it a sustainable business, we need to build solutions that can help close the gap between customer intentions to shop more sustainably and their actions. We need to make second-hand as convenient and attractive as the traditional linear model. This is why we offer an integrated second-hand offer at hm.com in Germany and Sweden. 
It needs to make economic sense to scale initiatives. We address this challenge and discuss how to incentivise a scalable transition in our position paper on circular business models as a means to prevent waste. 
We publish our Sustainability Disclosure annually. In this document, we set out our goals and the progress we’ve made in the previous year. Find the latest version here. More up to date information can be included on this page.

Synthetics
We need a mix of fibres to make products that last longer and are used more. Synthetics offer important functionality to products that can’t be achieved by natural fibres. 
Our synthetic fibres
Around 22% of the materials we source are synthetic.1 Synthetic fibres are made from chemical compounds derived from fossil-fuel-derived resources. They are often stretchier, more durable, more waterproof and quicker drying than natural fibres, bringing important functionality to our products.
We are increasingly sourcing recycled synthetics instead of virgin fibres and by 2025, we aim to only source recycled polyester.
In 2024, 94% of the polyester we sourced was recycled. 2 
Polyester
Polyester is our most used synthetic fibre, and is especially common in sportswear. Increasingly we are switching to recycled polyester and by 2025 we are on track to phase out virgin, fossil-based polyester in support of Textile Exchange’s Recycled Polyester Challenge.
Post-consumer recycled bottles are often used to produce recycled polyester today. However, as part of our transition to building a circular eco-system, our focus is on scaling textile-to-textile recycling for synthetics.
Polyamide
Polyamide is often used to make underwear and tights, as well as outerwear. We get our recycled polyamide from materials like old fishing nets and carpets, as well as leftover waste from production. This saves natural resources and reduces waste.
Elastane
Elastane is often found in products where some elasticity is needed and is known for its resilience and stretchiness. We get our recycled elastane from leftover waste from production.
Polyurethane
Polyurethane, or PU, is commonly used in footwear and bags. We have moved away from conventional PU that contains the hazardous solvent DMFa and use DMFa free options that are better for human health and the environment.
Acrylic
Acrylic, a vegan alternative to wool, is crease-resistant and colourfast. We are currently exploring different options for recycled acrylic.
Projects and actions
Investing in recycled polyester
In early 2024 we co-founded Syre with Vargas Holding. The company aims to manufacture recycled polyester yarn with the same quality as virgin fibres, but at a lower impact on the environment.
Investing in biodegradable polyester
H&M Group Ventures invested in Kintra Fibers, an innovative materials science company that has developed a new bio-based and biodegradable polyester. Our Circular Innovation Lab continues supporting the project.
Advanced recycled polyester
Our Circular Innovation Lab are working with suppliers to evaluate advanced recycled polyester, including Sysav’s automatic sorting of post-consumer textiles and Ioniqa’s recycling process to obtain high-purity polyester fibres.

Packaging
Packaging protects our products when transported, but it shouldn’t cause more damage than it prevents. 
The challenge
We use packaging when we transport our products between our suppliers, distribution centres and stores, as well as to our customers. It helps items arrive safely, reducing damage and waste.
However, all packaging uses resources, such as paper, plastic and energy, and it creates waste.
Our approach to packaging
We take a holistically approach, looking at reducing the amount of packaging we use, improving packaging design, prioritising recycled materials, and using only sustainably sourced material such as FSC certified paper if virgin material is required. Our strategy is based on Ellen MacArthur Foundation (EMF)’s key principles – eliminate waste and pollution, circulate products and materials (at their highest value), and regenerate nature. 
We’ve set several key goals for packaging, which support our wider climate, materials and circularity goals:
Absolute reduction in plastic packaging of 25% by 2025 (2018 baseline).
Design 100% of packaging to be recyclable, and where relevant reusable, by 2025.
Make 100% of packaging from recycled or sustainably sourced materials by 2030, with a preference for post-consumer recycled materials.
Reuse or recycle 100% of packaging from our own sites by 2025.
Projects and actions
Reducing packaging volume
We are reducing the amount of packaging we use by optmising its size and weight, as well as eliminating any unnecessary packaging.
Canopy
We support Canopy’s Pack4Good initiative, which encourages companies to think innovatively about packaging and switch to sustainable alternatives such as recycled fibres, fibres from sources such as agricultural residues, and FSC-certified sourced paper.
Tackling plastic pollution
Transport hangers make up the bulk of the plastic we use. We have set up a closed loop to make sure they are reused and then eventually recycled. Our next biggest use of plastic is polybags. We are reducing unnecessary ones and optimising the size of those we use to transport products. In addition, we are testing solutions to cut the volume of polybags we use and where we do use plastic in our polybags, we are increasing the share of postconsumer recycled plastic.
Swapping plastic for paper
Upgrading our packaging for online purchases to FSC certified paper bags and cardboard boxes has helped us take an important step towards becoming more circular. We’ve phased out single-use plastic for online orders, so we can get our products to our customers in easy to recycle packaging.
Global commitment on plastic
To fight plastic pollution, we have signed the global commitment on plastic, led by Ellen MacArthur Foundation in collaboration with the UN Environment Programme, to support a common vision to develop a circular economy for plastics in which plastic never becomes waste or pollution.
Fashion Pact
Fashion Pact is a global coalition of companies committed to key environmental goals in three areas: stopping global warming, restoring biodiversity and protecting the oceans. As part of the Fashion Pact, we are working towards eliminating unnecessary and problematic plastic and increasing the amount of recycled plastic in packaging.
We publish our Sustainability Progress Report annually. In this document, we set out our goals and the progress we’ve made in the previous year. Find the latest version here. More up to date information can be included on this page.

Sustainable Impact Partnership Program
We work closely with our business partners around the world to make sure we produce affordable, quality products that meet our high environmental and social standards.
Our designs are produced by suppliers that are not owned by us. Therefore, it’s essential we work towards the same ambitions and have the same mindset to ensure compliance with our standards, drive performance and achieve impact.
Through our Sustainable Impact Partnership Programme (SIPP) we support our business partners to raise their environmental and social performance. We reward high-achieving and responsible suppliers with training opportunities and long-term contracts. We want each supplier to take ownership of their sustainability agenda to drive environmental and social progress through their business and across our whole industry.
Our suppliers must sign our Sustainability Commitment. This summarises the areas we work on to make our supply chain more sustainable. It covers transparency and collaboration, supply chain due diligence, impact on people and the environment. SIPP assesses our suppliers’ performance and their level of compliance with our Sustainability Commitment. The main components include minimum requirements verification, self-assessment, verification, capacity building, grievance mechanisms and workers voice, dealing with incidents and violations.
Minimum requirements
Before starting any relationship with a supplier, we conduct a minimum requirement assessment. All suppliers must pass this assessment before we place an order with them. We then conduct regular follow up assessments to ensure our minimum requirements continue to be met.
Self-assessment
Through self-assessment our suppliers report annual performance data and management system indicators, which helps us to understand their readiness and resilience.
We support industry-wide collaboration tools that avoid duplication and promote transparency. This is why we use the Higg facility tools, developed by Cascale (previously named Sustainable Apparel Coalition or SAC), to assess performance and management systems in SIPP.
We were one of the first brands to incorporate both the Facility Environmental Module (FEM) and the Facility Social Labour Module (FSLM) into our supply chain sustainability programme. Today 100% of the manufacturing factories making our fashion and shoes are covered under SIPP, and over 400 processing factories and fabric mills report their performance in FEM.
Read more about Cascale and the Higg Index.
Verification
Our Suppliers conduct a self-assessment using FEM and FSLM, which is verified by a Cascale approved third-party. This ensures that all parts of the modules are accurately completed and assures credibility.
The latest verified submission is used if a supplier has submitted verified modules in the last twelve months. Exception is the Facility Profile section where the most up to-date facility information will be used.
FSLM helps manufacturers, brands, and retailers understand the social and labour impacts of their value chain, reduce audit fatigue, and make proactive improvements It uses the Social & Labor Convergence Program (SLCP) assessment tool and process, asking the same questions from the SLCP Data Collection Tool and following the SLCP verification protocol. FSLM is an Accredited Host, which means they enable the SLCP assessment process on their platform and provide additional data analytics and sharing services to users such as brands, standard holders, and manufacturers. 
To see more information on the verification processes for FEM please refer to FEM Verification Protocol.
The table below shows the number and share of supplier factories with participation and verification in FSLM .
Supplier factories participation and verification in FSLM 2022 2023 2024
Tier 1 supplier factories participating in FSLM (number and %) 843 (66%) 876 (68%) 739 (71%)
Tier 2 supplier factories participating in FSLM (number and %) 501 (52%) 442 (61%) 543 (56%)
Tier 1 third-party verifications for FSLM (and % of those participating) 843 (100%) 790 (90%) 690 (93%)
Tier 2 third-party verifications for FSLM (and % of those participating) 501 (100%) 415 (94%) 510 (94%)
For more information on the definition of tier 1 and 2 factories in our production supply chain visit our supply chain page.
Only suppliers that we actively work with and whose sustainability grading is approved are included in Higg reporting scope. For suppliers not included, please see below section “How we work with factories outside the Higg scope”.
Note that factories operating in countries with a Better Work Presence and factories wishing to enrol in Better Work for the purposes of data sharing via SLCP, will be able to do so according to the agreed rollout schedule in each Better Work country. In such cases, they should indicate their preference in the Better Work Supplier Portal. Enrolled facilities can complete a Better Work assessment and share their data through the SLCP Gateway.
In Cambodia all our factories are part of Better Factories Cambodia (BFC). BFC conducts regular workplace assessments at exporting garment factories, using checklists and criteria that determine compliance with the Cambodian Labour Law and the ILO’s core conventions.
Factories completing Better Work assessments only are excluded from FSLM verifications shares in the above table. This only includes factories where verification is finalised. Read more about Better Work. 
Capacity building
Verified assessments, including annual surveys, regular performance data and Cascale tools, are used to identify supplier compliance, impacts, risks, strengths and weaknesses. This information then supports our suppliers to set focus areas and goals for improvement.
Depending on our strategic priorities, we provide support through capacity-building workshops, training and management system analysis. We take a holistic approach to continuous improvement at our suppliers, which includes quality and other business indicators as well as sustainability performance. We encourage our suppliers to develop their own strategies and solutions to challenges, as well as providing incentives to shift impacts from negative to positive.
Grievance mechanisms and worker voice
It is important to us that workers can report concerns and have their voices heard. Depending on a supplier’s level of risk or case history, we may require or recommend a factory to invest in a digital grievance mechanism.
Dealing with incidents and violations
Our approach to a report of noncompliance depends on the severity of the violation. We may issue a letter of concern and a corrective action plan, and engage with suppliers and affected stakeholders on remediation actions, including training or changes to policies and processes. In cases of severe noncompliance or if a supplier does not respond to remedial actions, we may end business the relationship.
How we work with factories outside the Higg scope
We take a risk-based approach to monitoring our business partners’ compliance and apply different levels and methods of evaluation depending on the nature of the goods and services provided. Facilities outside of the Higg Index scope are:
Small facilities with less than 25 workers, without the resources to fill in extensive Higg modules.
Newly constructed facilities that do not yet have a year of data for verification.
Facilities with low business, unable to cover the costs of Higg modules and verification.
All these facilities are covered by annual minimum requirement assessments, performed either by our internal team or by a certified third party. After several years where routines were disrupted due to COVID-19 lockdowns, we prioritised on-site unannounced visits to all our approved factories to conduct minimum requirement assessments.
We have now changed our monitoring routine from 100% third-party verifications to include more regular minimum requirement assessments by our staff.

Dividend
Dividend policy
The board of directors’ intention is for the H&M group to continue to provide shareholders with a good return while ensuring that growth and investments in the business can proceed with a continued strong financial position and freedom of action. Based on this, the board of directors has proposed a dividend policy stating that the ordinary dividend over time is to exceed 50 percent of profit after tax and additionally that identified surplus liquidity – taking into consideration the capital structure target and investment requirements – can be distributed to shareholders through an extra dividend or a buyback programme.
Proposed dividend
The board of directors is proposing to the 2025 annual general meeting that a dividend of SEK 6.80 per share (6.50) is paid. The dividend will be paid in cash, split into two instalments. The first payment of SEK 3.40 will be made in May and the second payment of SEK 3.40 will be made in November. The board’s proposed record dates are 9 May 2025 and 7 November 2025. If the annual general meeting approves the board’s proposal, the dividend is expected to be paid out on 14 May 2025 and 12 November 2025.

Content:
Working conditions
As a large global company, we have responsibilities for all of our 138,000 employees — but also for the over 1.4 million textile workers employed by our suppliers. We want everyone to be treated with respect and work in a safe and healthy environment.
H&M Group has been managing these issues for more than 20 years, constantly moving closer to our ambition to become a Fair and Equal company. As with many other brands, we don’t own the factories — instead, we collaborate with over 570 tier 1  suppliers, representing more than 1,100 factories that also produce for other brands.
Securing good working conditions
Everyone should have access to decent, meaningful jobs with fair compensation and benefits, in safe and secure workplaces that are free from discrimination and with the right to freedom of association. This is true of our employees and people working in our production supply chain. Our work is aligned with the International Labour Organisation’s Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work and informed by its definition of decent work.
We are careful when entering new partnerships and are committed to choosing partners who share our respect for people and the environment, and who are willing to work with us to improve their practices. Our employees in our production offices work directly with our  suppliers and their factories to form good relations, assess their performance against our Sustainability Commitment, and support them in making improvements through various programmes and activities. Through our Sustainable Impact Partnership Programme (SIPP) we support our business partners in raising their environmental and social performance. Not only do our employees in production offices have close relationships with our business partners, but also with non-governmental organisations, experts, stakeholders and local governments. This gives them insight into the challenges involved and an understanding of how to drive improvements locally. Once we form a partnership, we work together with the supplier to improve their sustainability performance through training and capacity building. Sustainability performance is an important factor when deciding which suppliers to do business with.   
The Accord on Fire and Building Safety in Bangladesh
H&M Group is committed to contributing to fire, building and electrical safety in our supply chain. We were one of the first signatories of the Accord on Fire and Building Safety in Bangladesh, which was signed in 2013. It was an agreement between the international trade union IndustriALL Global Union and more than 200 apparel brands and retailers to make fire, electrical and structural improvements in the Bangladesh ready-made garment industry. 
Under the Accord, all factories producing for Accord signatory companies, including H&M Group, undergo independent regular fire, electrical and structural safety inspections. These inspection reports, as well as the corrective action plans (CAPs) are then disclosed publicly to ensure full transparency and accountability. 
Since the Accord started in 2013, the textile industry in Bangladesh has gone through a remarkable change regarding to workers’ safety. The Accord covered over 1,600 factories in Bangladesh, representing over 2 million workers. Since it began, over 38,000 inspections of factories have been carried out and over 1,200 Accord-covered factories have invested significantly to implement over 90% of the issues identified in their Corrective Actions Plans.  Working on the ground in Bangladesh, we can see the progress that has been made. 
The initial five year agreement came to an end in 2018, but its successful work was extended for three years through the 2018 Transition Accord Agreement. This renewed agreement gave continuity to the work achieved and recognised that, at the end of the three year period, the work would be handed over to a national regulatory body. 
In May 2020, the Accord operations in Bangladesh were transferred to the then newly founded RMG Sustainability Council (RSC). This is a Bangladesh not-for-profit organisation with tripartite governance structures and equal representation on the board of directors of international brands, trade unions and suppliers. RSC adopted all Accord protocols and articles and has maintained operations since the Transition Accord ended in May 2021.  In collaboration with all stakeholders, we aim to secure the continued success of the RSC. 
We want to continue to involve a wide range of actors pushing for change across the textile industry in Bangladesh, not only the factories producing for H&M Group. This way we can — together with other companies, global trade unions, employers’ organisations and the Bangladeshi government — actively influence and contribute to improved workplace safety in the textile industry. 
In August 2021, a new agreement called the International Accord for Health and Safety in the Textile and Garment Industry was signed between H&M Group, trade unions and other brands. The agreement, which was a continuation of the previous legally binding commitments, took effect on 1 September 2021. In January 2023, H&M Group signed a new agreement between global brands and trade unions with the aim to further protect the health and safety of garment workers in Pakistan. 
This agreement is a legally binding commitment and will, in collaboration with industry stakeholders in Pakistan, continue our joint efforts on this very important area. 
The Responsible Trucking platform and the Truck Transport Social Guidelines
In 2021, H&M Group became one of 11 partners in the collaborative platform Responsible Trucking, which is facilitated by CSR Europé. The partnership aims to improve the social conditions of truck drivers in the road transport and logistics sector across Europe.  
As a first step, the Social Guidelines have been released. They reflect a joint commitment concerning truck drivers’ working conditions, including among others forced labour, working and resting times, remuneration and health  
To move from guidelines to practical implementation, Responsible Trucking has an integrated approach focused on: 
Implementing an industry-wide spot-check tool that will allow hearing the voice of the drivers.
Organising capacity building activities aimed at supporting transport buyers and suppliers empower drivers.
Engaging with key stakeholders.

Content:
Man-made cellulosic fibres
Viscose, lyocell and modal are all types of man-made cellulosic fibres, also known as regenerated cellulosic fibres.
The challenge
Man-made cellulosic fibres (MMCF) are made from natural plant materials, for example wood pulp. If this wood is not sourced responsibly, it can lead to the destruction of ancient and high conservation value forests. The manufacture of MMCFs can also cause concern and the processing chemicals should be handled in a closed-loop.
Our approach
We are strengthening our sourcing requirements for MMCF to protect ancient and high conservation value forests. In addition we are increasingly using next generation MMCFs and supporting the use of closed-loop manufacturing.
Since 2020, our suppliers only source MMCF from fibre producers with a low risk of using wood from ancient and endangered forests, as indicated by a Green Shirt in the CanopyStyle Hot Button Report.
And by the end of 2025, we aim to source all our MMCF from responsible certified sources, or to replace them with next generation fibres made from sources such as agricultural residues and pre- and post- consumer textiles such as Infinna and Circulose.*
* Certified sources are FSC or PEFC.
Projects and activities
The Canopystyle Initiative and Forestmapper
In 2014 we began working with Canopy and other fashion brands through the CanopyStyle Initiative, which aims to end the use of ancient and endangered forests in the MMCF industry. The initiative also supports the development of next-generation fibres made from innovative sources such as agricultural residues and recycled textiles. We were also one of the founding members of the CanopyStyle Leaders for Forest Conservation.
In addition, we financially contributed to the development of the ForestMapper, which helps companies identify risks connected to forests and allows them to make more informed purchasing decisions around fibre sourcing and forest products.
Roadmap Towards Responsible Viscose
We have signed the Roadmap towards responsible viscose and modal fibre manufacturing initiated by Changing Markets. The objective of the roadmap is to move viscose and modal producers towards a closed-loop manufacturing system. It also sets out general requirements for responsible brands regarding:
sourcing policies
supply chain transparency
assessment of supply chain
monitoring of production facilities
grievance and remediation procedures
Traceability
In line with the roadmap, we have our own MMCF sourcing requirements and work with TextileGenesis to improve traceability. Using block-chain technology, we can trace MMCF from fibre to final product. As part of our sourcing requirements we are committed to disclose all of our MMCF suppliers. Today most of the viscose we use comes from Birla and Lenzing. We also source from Enka and Tangshan Sanyou. You can view the full list of our MMCF suppliers here.
Together with the other brands we are gradually working towards the 2025 goal: to only source from producers of viscose and other MMCF fibres found to have good environmental practices, such as closed-loop processing of water and chemicals. All our MMCF producers are required to complete Textile Exchanges’s Transparency Questionnaire, which monitors their sustainability performance including how they meet ZDHC Man-Made Cellulosic Fibre guidelines.
We publish our Sustainability Disclosure annually. In this document, we set out our goals and the progress we’ve made in the previous year. Find the latest version here. More up to date information can be included on this page.

Built Environment
We build and operate our stores, distribution centres and offices in a resource efficient and circular way, prioritising resilience and protecting natural resources.
Our strategy
To reduce the impact of our buildings, maintenance and furnishing process, we’ve created a Circular Built Environment Strategy. The strategy is based on Ellen MacArthur Foundation’s three principles of a circular economy – eliminating waste and pollution, circulating products and materials (at their highest value), and regenerating nature.
Designing out waste and pollution
Circularity starts with design. We are determined to use circular principals that build in the potential to repair, reuse and recycle at the design stage. We aim to only use recycled or sustainability sourced materials and we’re exploring how to scale use of materials with a lower environmental impact. By rethinking the way we build our stores, distribution centres and offices, and how we design and use interior products, we can keep materials in use, maximise their value and stop them from becoming waste
Re-using what we have
Wherever possible, we’re reusing and repairing interior and building materials in new stores and refurbishments. And we’re continuing to collaborate with partners to help scale circular business models. Alongside this we are exploring the possibility to re-sell or donate materials that we can’t reuse and, as a final step, we’re looking at recycling through certified waste management companies.
What we're doing
When constructing store formats, distribution centres and offices, we encourage the reuse and repair of existing interiors and building materials.
We make choices about materials and product design for stores based on estimated life span, ease of repair, maintenance and redesign, we well as end-of-life recyclability. For traceability, we have identified origin countries and regions for store interior materials. In addition, we are increasing the share of recycled material and when virgin materials are needed, we aim to only use sustainably sourced materials, such as FSCcertified paper and wood.

Sustainability Commitment
Our Sustainability Commitment is a set of requirements our partners must observe in order to do business with us
Sustainability is an integral part of being a successful business and we always aim to act in an ethical, transparent and responsible way. Naturally, we expect our business partners to do the same. Our Sustainability Commitment is a set of requirements that applies to everybody we do business with and is used by all our brands. It covers:
Transparency and collaboration
Supply chain due diligence
Impact on people
Impact on the environment
The commitment is based on internationally recognised standards and follows the law as a minimum. However, we always strive to go beyond this base level.
Updated Commitment
Since we launched our first Code of Conduct in 1997, we have continually updated the requirements to strengthen our standards and address the growing scope of sustainability issues. Our latest update in 2022 included:
A more explicit commitment to OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises and Due Diligence Guidance on Responsible Business Conduct.
A clear commitment to the Paris Agreement and the 1.5° target.
A more robust requirement for our business partners to carry out their own human rights and environmental due diligence in their supply chains.
Different versions for the different types of business in our value chain, for example manufacturers, logistics or transport. This means we can better address the specific risks of each individual industry.
Suppliers’ compliance is assessed via our Sustainability Impact Partnership Programme (SIPP) and, if needed, we offer support to raise their environmental and social performance.
History of our Sustainability Commitment
1997
We introduced our first Code of Conduct that set out how we expected our suppliers and their supply chain to act in terms of working conditions and environmental practices.
2016
The Code of Conduct was replaced by our Sustainability Commitment, which covered more topics and more business relationships.
2022
We updated the Sustainability Commitment to widen its scope and to reflect updates to legislation.
The commitment is reviewed on a yearly basis.
If you would like to raise a concern or notify us of a suspected breach of the Sustainability Commitment, or any other policy, please report it to our Speak Up! Channel.

Sustainability
For almost 30 years, we’ve been working with sustainability. It's part of our business idea - to offer our customers the best combination of fashion, quality, price and sustainability - and we believe that sustainable fashion should not be limited to the few.
We’ve made a lot of progress, however there is still much more to do. Across our industry, we need to reduce our impact on the climate, improve our social impact and build a better fashion system. And we need to do this transparently.
OUR SUSTAINABILITY GOALS
Our key sustainability focus areas
We’re passionate about driving change in the fashion industry through collaboration, increasing our transparency, and pioneering new materials, technologies and business models.
LEADING THE CHANGE
We aim to achieve net-zero emissions by 2040. We also want to move away from relying on new resources, by keeping products and materials in use for as long as possible.
CIRCULARITY AND CLIMATE
Across our business, we work with hundreds of millions of people all over the world. We are committed respecting their rights and managing our impact responsibly.

Circularity
By shifting towards a circular ecosystem we can address some of the biggest challenges facing our planet at this time such as climate change and biodiversity loss.
Our circular approach
Fast depletion of natural resources, inadequate global systems for circulating products and materials, and a growing global waste problem are major risks for our planet and our business. Our use of resources negatively impacts the environment and people across our value chain.
At H&M Group, we recognise our responsibility and the opportunity to act. We are reducing our reliance on new materials by shifting towards recycled or responsibly sourced alternatives. We optimise our production processes, design products and packaging with circularity in mind, and develop innovative solutions to help customers extend product life. By collaborating with industry partners and stakeholders, we are building stronger circular systems to secure resources for the future and protect our environment.
Our focus areas
Materials
We focus on increasing the use of recycled or sustainably sourced materials across our value chain. Through investment and industry collaboration, we help to scale innovative and alternative materials and reduce the impact of the materials we use.
Business optimisation
By optimising our assortment planning and aligning production with demand, we reduce waste and improve resource efficiency across our supply chain.
Product and packaging design
We strive to maximise the value of resources and products by keeping them in use for longer. We do this by embedding circular principles into the design of our products and packaging, ensuring they are used for longer and easier to reuse and recycle.
Extending customer use
Through customer-facing circular business models we aim to offer customers ways to prolong the life of our products, keeping them in use for longer and reducing waste.
Waste prevention and management
We focus on reducing waste where possible and ensuring that our waste is properly handled in line with the waste hierarchy. We aim for zero waste to end up in landfills, and that we recirculate products and materials at their highest value.
Circular ecosystem in action
Building a circular ecosystem is a continuous journey with many interdependencies both within and outside H&M Group.
We are aligning supply and demand, and increasing material efficiency. We invest in AI and tech tools for improved planning and accuracy, and customer centricity.
Using fewer materials, improving resource efficiency and expanding circular solutions begins with how we design our products. However, the lack of industry standards presents a challenge. We collaborate with brands and experts, such as the Circular Design Consortium and Ellen MacArthur Foundation to develop circular design methods, grow circular product design, share knowledge and address common challenges. As a voting member of the PEFCR Apparel & Footwear technical secretariat, we contribute to developing a common EU method for sharing product impact information. This framework also helps us to improve transparency.
Our goal is for 100% of our materials to be either recycled or sustainably sourced by 2030, including our ambition for 50% recycled materials. We test, invest in and scale more innovative materials through our brands, Circular Innovation Lab, H&M Group Ventures, and green investments — for example, investments in Infinited Fiber Company, TreeToTextile, and Fairbrics — and bridge the commercialisation gap through our supply chain network.
We test, invest in and scale innovative production processes that can lower use of water, energy and chemicals — such as dyeing, washing and finishing — through our brands, Circular Innovation Lab, H&M Group Ventures, and green investments. These include investments in Colorifix and Alchemie Technology, and investments in pilots such as with Recycrom.
We offer use and care advice, information, and products across our brands to prolong the life of our products.
We offer remake advice, information and services across our brands to prolong the life of our products — for example through COS Full Circle and its partnership with The Seam, H&M Take Care, and ARKET repair partners.
We increase access to, and invest in, piloting and scaling customer-facing circular business models, such as resell, across H&M Group in stores and online. These include Sellpy, H&M Preloved, ARKET Archive, COS Full Circle, COS Restore and COS Resell, and in-store second hand at Weekday and Monki.
We support scaling technology and infrastructure to collect and sort products and materials — we collect used textiles at our brands and sort them so they can be circulated at their highest value for reuse and recycling.
We support scaling technology and infrastructure to recycle and circulate materials at their highest value. We invest in recycling technology and infrastructure with partners including Infinited Fiber Company and Ambercycle. We focus on textile waste in production, post–consumer textiles, and collaboration to advance progress.
Putting people at the centre of circular fashion
We know a lot about the environmental impact of a circular fashion industry, but we have lots to learn about the impact on people, including understanding what it means for jobs across the fashion value chain.
In 2021, we worked with several partners on Keeping Workers in the Loop. This report looked at the impact on employment of moving to a circular fashion system and recommended how to create a just, fair and inclusive fashion industry. Since it was launched, we have worked with the report’s key learnings to build our knowledge and to define how we can secure fair and equal circular jobs across our value chain.
We publish our Sustainability Disclosure annually. In this document, we set out our goals and the progress we’ve made in the previous year. Find the latest version here. More up to date information can be included on this page.

Water
Life on earth relies on water and so does our industry. Yet water scarcity and quality are critical global issues. We are committed to reducing our own impact and working with others to manage water responsibly.
The link between climate change and water is well established. Around the world we are seeing floods, droughts and changing rainfall patterns, as well as water scarcity and pollution. In early 2022, a reassessment of the planetary boundary for freshwater shows we have crossed the safe-zone limit, risking deforestation and soil degradation.
We need to act. The fashion industry is one of the biggest users of water, from the production of raw materials to washing and dyeing fabrics. We must collaborate with governments, brands and other stakeholders to tackle water issues on a basin or catchment area level. We all have a responsibility to use less water, to minimise pollution and keep water clean for future generations.
Science based targets
We took part in a pilot for Science Based Targets for Nature (SBTN) and submit water quantity and quality targets for key basins with support from our partner, WWF. SBTN’s guidelines help us align efforts in high-risk basins by using local scientific models and a shared approach with stakeholders. This supports our water strategy 2030, which focuses on contextual targets.
Water strategy 2030
We’ve focused on becoming more water efficient and improving water in some of the world’s most stressed water basins. However, with increasing water scarcity, we must accelerate our efforts and expand our impact.
Our vision is to have a positive impact on water by 2030. We want to build a business that is resilient to water crises and catalyse innovation to enable the fashion industry to decouple from water.
Contextual targets
We used WWF’s Water Risk Filter to assess our value chain and set our contextual water targets.
SCARCITY
QUALITY
GOVERNANCE
WASH
FLOODING
2030 target: scarcity
30% reduction in absolute freshwater extraction and use against a 2022 baseline1.
Target 2025
In all basins, 10% reduction in absolute total freshwater use against an averaged 2022 baseline.
Target 2027
In medium to high-risk basins, 20% reduction in absolute total freshwater use against an averaged 2022 baseline.
Target 2029
In medium to high-risk basins 30% reduction in absolute total freshwater use against an averaged 2022 baseline.
Five focus areas
Circularity
We will continue to work towards our contextual targets1, addressing water issues on a local level as well as engaging in water stewardship2 with partners and stakeholders.
Leadership
To inspire our business partners, we will share benchmarks and create internal targets to incentivise better water performance.
Investment
We will invest in innovations to improve water management, introduce new recycled materials and regenerative landscape projects. In addition, we support supply chain actors to adopt water efficient practices and technology.
Change mindsets
We need to ensure our organisation understands and values water better. To facilitate this shift in mindsets, we visualise and create measurements for water use and impact when, for example, we design our clothes.
Ecosystem innovation
To enable collaboration with stakeholders and partners, we are committed to disclose our water related actions, our dependencies and our performance.

Our projects
Cutting water use in our supply chain
We have invested in waterless dyeing technologies at two suppliers, Arvind in India and Chorka Textiles in Bangladesh, with the potential to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and water use by half. Once fully operational in 2025, we will assess their performance and potential to scale.
WWF partnership
We have worked with WWF for over a decade on water. Recently, we supported the NGO to produce a series reports encouraging the fashion industry to take a more holistic approach to water issues. Eau Courant discusses the impact of the industry on water, Avant-Garde looks at the risks, and Ensemble details how the industry should collaborate to scale solutions. Find out more about our joint achievements here. Find out more about our joint achievements here.
Corporate Water Leaders Group
We support the Corporate Water Leaders Group, facilitated by Global Water Intelligence, which brings together fashion and homeware companies. The group is developing a water action framework to help brands and their supply chain partners build operational resilience and mitigate water impacts.
1 Working to improve water at our suppliers will have a limited impact in a basin. Water stewardship allows us to manage water on a bigger scale that considers all users within a basin. This includes local communities, business, agriculture and biodiversity.
2 Instead of setting general targets that cover all suppliers, contextual targets allow us to respond better to the individual water challenges of each of our supplier facilities. Our contextual targets address water scarcity, water quality, governance, WASH (water, sanitation and hygiene), flooding and climate induced events.
We publish our sustainability progress report annually. In this document, we set out our goals and the progress we’ve made in the previous year. Find the latest version here. More up to date information can be included on this page.

Audit committee
H&M Group’s audit committee is appointed annually by the board of directors. The audit committee consists of Christian Sievert (chair) along with Anders Dahlvig (member) and Helena Saxon (member).
The committee’s meetings, at which minutes are always taken, are usually also attended by CFO, the head of finance & accounting, the head of investor relations and the head of corporate governance and the company’s auditors. Various specialists, e.g. in POD/HR, Expansion, Security, Business Tech and Data Protection Officer.
The Audit Committee oversees H&M Group’s financial reporting, including compliance with legal requirements on statutory sustainability reporting, and the effectiveness of the company’s risk management and internal control, ensuring impacts, risks and opportunities are appropriately managed — including those related to sustainability. The committee oversees all auditing topics and publication of company financial reports. The Audit Committee also assists the Nomination Committee with any proposals to the AGM concerning the election of auditors.
The Audit Committee reviews and monitors the impartiality and independence of the auditors and determines which assignments the accounting firm may conduct for H&M Group in addition to the audit. The auditors provide an annual written statement to the Audit Committee providing assurance of the auditors’ independence and outlining which additional services the accounting firm has provided to H&M Group during the financial year.
The audit committee continually receives information and supporting documentation for decision-making from, among others, the CEO, the CFO and the company’s external auditors. A further task of the audit committee is to ensure that accurate information is provided promptly to the board.
Read more about the work of the Audit Committee during 2023 in our Corporate Governance Report on pages 13-14.

Empowering people
Our business is made up of people – for people. What matters to people, matters to us. At H&M Group, our goal is for every colleague to feel good while doing good work, in an environment free from any form of discrimination.
Our success is based on our diverse employees
We are a global company, which means we have colleagues from many different cultures and backgrounds. As such, we respect and reflect all people and cultures by creating an inclusive, diverse and equitable environment in our entire organisation.
All employees of the H&M group contribute to the company’s success. The diversity of the workforce in terms of age, gender and ethnicity, among others, is tremendously valuable to us.
How we make it happen
Our initiatives are divided into three main lines of action:
1. Increased awareness of inclusion and diversity through training  
At any time, employees can access our robust inclusion and diversity curriculum filled with resources that address common workplace issues. These learning paths review current thinking and best practices on essential topics such as unconscious bias, inclusive leadership, cultural appropriation and representation, psychological safety and various others. Trainings are available for all employees through internal learning platforms. We also have a collaborative forum that enables inclusion and diversity community/responsibles to come together, share ideas and co-create a successful strategy.
2. Improved diverse representation
Recruitment processes
Building more diverse teams represents an important part of our inclusion and diversity work. To do so, and to be fully inclusive when acquiring new talent, we have structured, fair, transparent and competency-based recruitment processes to minimise subjectivity and bias. Committed managers and HRs trained to understand why and how we should build diverse teams ensure that we create internal and external talent pipelines, expand our diversity recruitment and increase our representation.
3. Equity: ensure fair and equal opportunities
The People Engagement Pulses
Our employee survey, The People Engagement Pulses (PEP), allows our colleagues to voice their opinions. This online survey covers employee engagement, culture, inclusion and diversity. The outcome of PEP helps us create a base for discussion and actions for our colleagues and businesses to develop and grow. We also conduct a survey dedicated solely to inclusion and diversity. The Inclusion and Diversity Pulse gives us an opportunity to receive feedback and input around important topics linked to inclusion and diversity such as equal opportunities, discrimination, belonging, our diversity commitment, acceptance and much more.
LEAD
We offer development programs like our LEAD (Learn, Educate, Accelerate and Develop) program in H&M US, to help employees with their career progression. LEAD identifies internal talent from traditionally underrepresented or marginalised groups. It offers an accelerated one-year program to develop their leadership skills while pairing selected individuals with mentors and coaches from the H&M US organisation. Meant to empower new talent, LEAD aims to create a stable, diverse and sustainable system to build inclusivity into the foundation of future leadership. We are looking to expand the programme outside of the US in the near future.
Colleague Resource Groups
To enable belonging and a culture of inclusion at H&M Group, we have Colleague Resource Groups (CRGs) – voluntary, colleague-led groups supported by the organisation, aimed at fostering a diverse and inclusive workplace. The CRGs are a safe space where colleagues can connect, build community, network with leaders and peers, and develop personally and professionally. They enable greater cultural agility, strengthen colleague engagement and celebrate and value our colleagues’ unique differences.

Gender equality in our supply chain
We believe in a society free from bias where everybody has an equal voice and representation. We aim to be inclusive across our whole value chain, to treat people fairly and to give everybody access to the same opportunities. And we want to protect workers from discrimination and harassment.
Why we work with gender equality
We rely on over 1.4 million people, mostly women, to make our products. The factories that employ them are spread across over 45 different countries. Each country has a different culture, societal norms, legal contexts and levels of gender equality. We are committed to achieving equal opportunities and well-being for all women working in the apparel sector.
We have signed the Women’s Empowerment Principles and we are working towards Sustainable Development Goal number 5 (SDG5), which aims to achieve gender equality and empower all women and girls by 2030.
How we work with gender equality in our supply chain
Across our supply chain we target four areas :
Health and safety
Career and development
Wages
Representation
And we work at three different levels:
Worker empowerment
Factory management systems
Industry and country transformation
In 2020, we consulted with Plan International to update and strengthen our gender equality strategy.
There are specific challenges related to gender that demand extra attention. For example, gender-based violence and harassment (GBVH) is a widespread human rights violation that happens in all industries.
We support any measures that offer greater protection of workers, for example the International Labour Organization’s Convention 190 and  Recommendation 206, which recognise everybody’s right to a work environment free from violence and harassment. These are powerful tools governments can use to strengthen local laws to prevent GBVH and can support our efforts to be a fair and equal company.
Our four focus areas
Health & safety
We want all women to be empowered, healthy and safe in their everyday working life.
Health & safety is the foundation of our gender equality work, and we expect our supplier factories to set up and run health and safety committees. We support them to strengthen grievance systems, so more women feel comfortable reporting workplace issues such as sexual harassment. In addition, many factories we work with are enrolled in training courses and external collaborations that raise awareness of, and prevent, sexual harassment and other gender-related issues.
Example: Gender-based violence and harassment guideline and training
During 2022 we improved our approach to preventing, detecting and handling cases of GBVH. We worked with Jane Pillinger (Ph.D), a global expert on gender equality and gender-based violence at work, on a series of training courses and workshops for employees working with social sustainability in our production supply chain and National Monitoring Committees. The sessions raised awareness and provided supporting tools for suppliers to prevent GBVH and handle grievances.
Working in collaboration with IndustriAll and its affiliates, we also created a GBVH guideline for suppliers based on ILO convention 190. The guideline gathers best practice on detecting, preventing, and handling GBVH cases. We rolled out the guideline to our tier 1 suppliers during summer 2023.
This joint work was recognised in the Global Deal (OECD/ILO) Flagship Report 2022.
In 2024, we worked with trade unions to select 20 factories employing around 30,500 workers to carry out gap analyses in relation to our GBVH guideline to address the issues at their facilities.
Example: Multi-stakeholder project addressing sexual harassment and violence in India
We are founding members of the Textile Industry Coalition (TiC), launched in India in 2024. The initiative unites brands, manufacturers, government agencies, trade unions, civil society groups and research institutions. Together, we promote zero tolerance for sexual harassment and violence in Tamil Nadu, India. TiC currently works with 13 production units across Tamil Nadu and supports community projects in six districts. The initiative has eight modules to address issues at factories and within communities. Five modules have already started as training programmes.
Representation
We want women to have equal participation, voice and leadership in social dialogue, including all worker representation forums.
When women participate in workplace dialogue structures, everybody benefits. Issues important to women are more likely to be put forward, which builds a foundation for good working conditions. We work with suppliers, peers and trade unions to support worker representation and provide training about democratically electing representatives. Industrial relations and workplace dialogue programmes like these reach over 1.1 million workers in our supply chain. Today, 65% of workplace representatives in our tier 1 production supply chain are women. We also partner with IndustriALL Global Union to support trade unions in our supply chain.
Example: Better Work project in Cambodia
In 2023, over 80% of our manufacturing suppliers in Cambodia work with Better Factories Cambodia (BFC) and establish a bipartite committee to foster a culture of improvement and support dispute resolution and prevention. The committees are made up of factory workers and management and facilitated by experienced BFC advisors.
Women make up over 50% of workers representatives in these bipartite committees, however they voice their concerns and ideas less frequently, and tend to follow discussions rather than initiate them. In 2019-2020, seven suppliers took part in tailor made training designed to strengthen the women’s leadership skills, covering topics like communication, solution finding, negotiating and participation in decisions.
In addition, women representatives at five suppliers took part in training on preventing GBVH in the workplace as part of a project organised by BFC, IndustriAll Global Union and us. This was part of a series of efforts to strengthen GBVH prevention and handling in conjunction with the roll out of our supplier guidelines on the subject.
Career and development
We want the number of women in leadership positions to reflect the proportion of women on staff.
Becoming a supervisor is often the first rung on the career ladder in factories. While research shows that women are treated with more respect in workplaces with more female leaders. Our ambition is that the ratio of women supervisors matches the ratio of women workers. However, in 2024 only 25% of supervisors in our tier 1 factories were women, while 61% of the workforce were. 
To give women the same career possibilities as men, we need to identify and tackle the barriers that hold them back. We encourage our suppliers to run training for women to provide them with the skills and confidence to get ahead and address limiting factors like societal norms.
Example: Gender Equality programmes in Bangladesh
In 2019, we launched a career development program for women in Bangladesh called Gender Equality and Returns (GEAR). Working with International Finance Corporation and Better Work, the idea is to create more career progression opportunities for female workers in our supply chain. Since the start of the program 47 supplier factories have enrolled in the GEAR program.
Women at these factories follow a tailored training programme to empower them, develop their leadership skills and give them the technical skills they need to become a supervisor. Participants say the program helped them both at work and home. The soft skills they gained were also recognised by factory management as crucial for creating positive change. 
In 2022, we initiated our own Women’s Empowerment (WE) programme to promote female supervisors in our supply chain. In the first year, we trained 43 women workers across nine factories in soft skills and leadership. The women also received technical training from the industrial engineering teams in their factories. At the end of the programme, 24 trainees were promoted. 
Wages  
We want men and women to receive equal remuneration for work of equal value.
However, according to UN Women the gender pay gap stands at 16%, which means women earn 84% of what men earn, no matter what industry they work in. Differences in pay add up and have daily negative consequences for women and their families. We are working to improve wages in our supply chain by helping factories to bring in effective wage management systems. These systems empower workers by raising awareness about wages and developing skills to improve them. They also help factories set a fair wage structure that isn’t influenced by a worker’s gender. According to research by independent experts, pay increased by 5% for all workers in factories with wage management systems compared to those without. You can find out more about our wages work here.
Example: Gender pay-gap study
Since 2021 we have worked with wages expert Professor Raymond Robertson to map and understand the gender pay-gap in our supply chain. Together we created a wage survey that collected data over two years on the wage and skill levels of workers at all our tier 1 suppliers, over 1,300 production units.
Initial findings show a statistically significant pay gap between men and women in most production countries. The pay gap varies across factories and countries and seems to grow as workers move up the pay scale. It appears to be driven by the skill gap between genders, as men tend to have acquired more technical skills and therefore benefit from higher wages. Men also are generally promoted at higher rates and get higher raises when promoted. Wage management system programmes help reduce wage gaps at the top of the wage scale. The findings from this research will help us build a targeted approach to address the issue in our supply chain factories.
Example: Closing the pay gap in China
We worked with seven factories in China to assess the gender pay gap and develop a roadmap that reduced it while raising the technical skills of female workers. As a result of the project, the gap closed from 15.3 percent in 2023 to 4.6 percent in 2024.

How we report
We are committed to transparent reporting on the progress we make towards achieving our sustainability strategy.
Basis for preparation of the sustainability report
Our sustainability reporting is based on the results of an impact materiality analysis covering an assessment of impacts across our own operations as well as our upstream and downstream value chain. For many years, H&M Group has been conducting its materiality analysis in line with applicable Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) Standards. In 2023, we began developing our materiality analysis process to align our approach with the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD) and the European Sustainability Reporting Standards (ESRS), along with EFRAG’s Implementation Guidance for Double Materiality. The annual and sustainability report 2024 and our impact materiality analysis has been prepared to align with the format of the upcoming reporting requirements but does not claim any compliance with the CSRD or the ESRS. The sustainability report is prepared in accordance with the GRI. Our annual and sustainability report complies with the applicable Swedish and EU legislation and the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) adopted by the EU and is prepared in accordance with the Swedish Annual Accounts Act.
Frameworks
Global Reporting Initative (GRI).We report according to the current GRI Standards. Download our  GRI Index 2024. 
UN Guiding Principles Reporting Index.  We were one of the first companies to report on human rights in line with the UNGP Reporting Framework in 2015. We regularly evaluate salient human rights issues in our materiality assessment. 
Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD). Our climate risk analysis follow TCFD recommendations. Read more in our annual and sustainability report.   
UN Global Compact and CEO Water Mandate. We are signatories to the UN Global Compact. Our annual sustainability reporting acts as our Communication on Progress for the UN Global Compact and CEO Water Mandate. and we disclose via the UN Global Compact digital reporting system. See our latest Communication on Progress.
Modern Slavery Act. We report in accordance with the UK Modern Slavery Act and the Australian Modern Slavery Act 2018 (Cth), as well as the Canadian Supply Chains Act. See our Modern slavery statement.
Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD): We are preparing to comply with CSRD, for example by integrating more sustainability content into our annual and sustainability report and strengthening our materiality assessment process.
We report in line with relevant legislation, including evolving human rights and due diligence policies developed by the European Union, Germany, Norway and the UK.
Read in detail about our climate data reporting method as well as the description of the KPIs which not have a predefined GRI standard and therefore, have been disclosed as our own indicators.

Human rights policy
We recognise our responsibility to operate with respect to human rights. Everybody deserves to be treated equally, and with respect and dignity. For us at H&M Group, respecting human rights is also about leading with our values and empowering people to be who they want to be.
Our committment
At H&M Group, we are committed to operating with respect to human rights across our value chain – in our own operations, across our supply chains and in the communities where we operate. It’s about what we do, and how we do it. 
This commitment is set out in our Human Rights Policy and applies to all entities within the H&M Group. The policy gives an overview of our priorities, key stakeholders, accountability and how we implement our commitment. We base our approach on the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights.
We adopted our first Human Rights Policy in 2012 and over the last decade our strategies have evolved. We have learnt along the way and our business model and the context in which we operate have also changed. It is against this backdrop that we reviewed and updated our Human Rights Policy in 2020. 
Governance
Our Board of Directors has adopted this Human Rights Policy on behalf of H&M Group. They have delegated the responsibility to implement the policy to senior operational executives that report to our CEO. The Head of Sustainability and Head of Corporate Governance oversee the overall implementation and report on progress and impact to the Board of Directors and the leadership team on a regular basis.  
We focus our efforts on our salient human rights issues and we apply a risk-based approach. Every year we review our salient human rights issues with internal and external stakeholders to ensure their relevance and to prioritise efforts and engagement.  Different functions and geographies carry out human rights risk and impact assessments, the outcomes of which form part of our corporate risk process.

Modern slavery statement
At H&M Group, we recognise our responsibility to respect human rights as stated in our Human Rights Policy. This policy also covers the issue of modern slavery as defined in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which is a comprehensive definition that includes forced labour as defined by the ILO Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work.
Since 1997, we have been working systematically to address the risk of forced labour and child labour in our global supply chain. In 2015, we identified forced labour as one of our salient human rights issues. We recognise that the risk of forced labour exists in various forms in all countries and across our value chain. Over the past year, we have broadened the scope of our work, deepened our understanding of risk and put in place responses to manage risk.
We strictly prohibit any type of forced labour, regardless of the market or region. All allegations made about H&M Group, a supplier or business partner are investigated. If we discover and verify a case of forced labour, we take immediate action. For business relationships this will lead to enforcement action, and if prompt corrective action is not taken or adequate remedy provided, the ultimate consequence will be termination.
Modern slavery and forced labour are often linked to systemic issues. Businesses have a responsibility to prevent these issues from occurring in their operations and supply chains, as set out in existing and evolving regulations.
This statement is made on behalf of H & M Hennes & Mauritz AB and all companies in the H&M Group, pursuant to the UK Modern Slavery Act, the Australian Modern Slavery Act 2018 (Cth), the California Transparency in Supply Chains Act, Canada’s Fighting Against Forced Labour and Child Labour in Supply Chains Act, as well as the German Supply Chain Act and the Norwegian Transparency Act. It applies to, and sets out the steps, the H&M group has taken to address modern slavery within its supply chain and its own business operations.

Supply chain
We are committed to building strong, long-term relations with our suppliers that are based on mutual trust and transparency.
Our supply chain is complex and our products can pass through many suppliers on their journey from raw materials to finished product. Like most clothing brands, we don’t own any factories. Instead we work with independent manufacturers. To increase transparency, we first published our supplier list in 2013. Since then we have continued to disclose more and more information. 
Our supply chain in numbers
We do business with over 570 commercial product suppliers who manufacture products for our brands in over 1,100 tier 1 factories in Europe, Asia and North America.1 
China and Bangladesh are the largest production markets for clothing.
The European Union is the largest production market for our beauty assortment.
Average length of a supplier relationship is 9 years, but we have been doing business with some for over 19 years.2
Around 1.4 million people are employed by the tier 1 and 2 supplier factories we work with, 61% of them are female.3
Around 0.12% of workers in our tier 1 and 2 factories are migrants.
We operate 15 local production offices, employing over 1,600 colleagues who work with our suppliers daily. 
37% of tier one factories have trade union representation.4, 5
698 tier one factories reported that worker representatives are freely chosen by the workers.4
Download our supplier list
Our supplier list discloses the details of our tier 1 suppliers and their manufacturing and processing factories, accounting for 99% of the products we sell.
The list also includes the names and locations of tier 2 mills that provide our suppliers with fabric, including tanneries and fabric dyeing and printing. We are working towards disclosing 100% of the fabric dyeing and printing locations involved in making our products.1
As participants of the Transparency Pledge we share the name, address, product type produced and number of workers employed at the factories. We also publish how long we have been working with the supplier, percentage of female workers, number of elected worker representatives and trade union presence.
We update this supplier list monthly.6
SUPPLIER LIST SPREADSHEET
We onboard new suppliers or factories and, occasionally, phase them out according to our business needs. When this happens we follow the ACT Responsible Exit Policy, which details how to exit a supplier relationship with minimal impact. Read more on our Responsible purchasing practices page.
You can also find our suppliers on the Open Supply Hub, an open-source tool that exists to improve human rights and environmental conditions in and around factories and facilities.
A typical fashion supply chain
From raw materials to finished item, our products pass through many different suppliers on their journey to our stores. These suppliers are arranged into several tiers to make our supply chain. Each tier does business with its immediately adjacent tiers.
Not all supply chains are the same and they can vary according to product type or materials used. Some of our supply chains are vertical – short with few tiers. Others can be horizontal and comprise several tiers.
Tier 1 are the companies we do business with directly and work with product manufacture or processing.
Companies working with component production and processing tend to fall into tiers 2 to 4.
Raw material production can cover tiers 4 to 6.
Manufacturing factories
These factories are either owned or contracted by our suppliers to make our products. They can also be called “cut and sew” factories or tier one suppliers. A single supplier can own or contract one or more factories. They are covered by our Sustainable Impact Partnership Programme (SIPP) that assesses their sustainability performance. All these factories report using industry standards such as Higg Facility Environmental Module and Social and Labor Convergence Program.4
Processing factories
These are factories that are subcontracted by our suppliers to carry out processes they can’t do inhouse, this could be embroidery or print making, for example. Processing factories can be subcontracted by several suppliers. They can also be both a manufacturing and a processing factory at the same time. All processing factories must be approved by our team and are treated in the same way as a direct supplier, for example, they are included in our SIPP.
Fabric mills
Tier two suppliers make fabrics and sell it to other suppliers. We work with our tier one suppliers to identify the mills producing fabric for our products so we can integrate them into our supplier assessment program, SIPP.

Advancing the inclusion of people
We drive inclusion and diversity with our global reach by creating a real sense of community across our brands, leading to positive change.
Lifting our communities
We want people to know H&M Group as an inclusive business that promotes inclusion and diversity throughout the whole value chain. Community, for us, means both external communities that are underserved, and communities within our organisation. We ensure that our presence contributes positively to the people and communities in which we live and work.
Read more about our commitment to being a fair and equal employer.
Partnerships
We use our business to support and promote equitable access to opportunities and equal rights for people who for various reasons lack these opportunities or face greater hurdles. Our various external partnerships and projects have become essential in helping us leverage these ambitions across our whole value chain.
Our focus is on refugees, gender equality, anti-racism, and the LGBTQIA+ community globally, through local partners and initiatives.
Some of our global partnerships include:
World Economic Forum’s Partnering for Racial Justice in Business
We joined World Economic Forum’s Partnering for Racial Justice in Business initiative. As a founding member, we have a chair in the advisory group/steering committee and the working group. The partnership’s overarching aim is to implement a compliant and harmonised global data collection approach. We hope to create a common language that establishes standards and universal principles for becoming an anti-racist organisation.
World Economic Forum’s Global Parity Alliance
In 2022, H&M Group also became a Founding Member of World Economic Forum’s Global Parity Alliance, a cross-industry group of companies taking action to accelerate diversity, equity and inclusion (DE&I) in the workplace and beyond. The Alliance seeks to promote DE&I best practices that benefit underrepresented groups and are hardwired across business processes, including creating equitable work opportunities, promoting supplier diversity and launching inclusive products and services.
Refugee Women Mentorship Initiative
H&M Group joined the Refugee Women Mentorship Initiative as well, led by Tent Partnership for Refugees (Tent) and Catalyst. The initiative focuses on mentoring refugee women to enhance their opportunities to enter employment. H&M Group currently participates in this initiative through the H&M brand in Germany, Italy and the Netherlands.  
Our local partnerships include the United Nations Free and Equal campaign, the Kaleidoscope Trust, The Trevor Project, and The Marsha P. Johnson Institute (MPJI), among others.

Leading the change
We want to lead the change towards a more sustainable fashion industry, using our size and scale to help speed up the transformation.
Our vision to lead the change means: innovating, incubating and investing in scaling new materials, technologies and business models with the potential to decouple our business growth from resource use.
It means trying to do things differently, daring to take the first step. It means sharing more data and working to improve the accuracy and comparability of industrywide disclosure. And finally, it means collaborating with others to change the way the industry works and create the legislative environment and infrastructure required for the fashion sector of the future.
VISION AND STRATEGY
KEY SUSTAINABILITY GOALS
We focus on three areas that maximise our impact
We need new materials, technologies and business models that promote circularity, decouple businesses from finite natural resources and enhance customer experience. We identify, test and scale new solutions that have the potential to transform our business and the fashion industry.
SCALING INNOVATION
To build trust and find joint solutions we communicate openly and honestly with colleagues, customers, investors and others about our business. Transparency alone will not improve sustainability performance, but it will create accountability and comparability, pushing us to improve and encouraging others in our industry to do the same.
PROMOTING TRANSPARENCY
An important part of our approach is openly engaging with others within and outside our industry. Engaging with diverse perspectives challenges us to do better, accelerates innovation and supports our transparency efforts. Partnerships help us progress towards our sustainability ambitions faster than we could alone and have a positive impact beyond our own value chain.

Chemicals
Chemicals are essential to our everyday lives and are used in the manufacturing of clothes, such as washing, dyeing and printing.
Good chemical management is crucial to ensure the safe use and reuse of textile materials. We put safety first by minimising pollution and preventing hazardous discharge into water or soil during production of our products.
Chemical roadmap
We focus on improving chemical management across our value chain to address environmental and human health hazards.
Traceability of input of chemicals used in the production of commercial goods.
Engagement to push for legislation and support public policies that promote progressive chemical management.
Transparency in sharing information about chemicals with customers, including full public disclosure of wastewater discharge test data.
Zero discharge of prioritised hazardous chemicals in the supply chain.
Collaboration ensuring clean factories that use common tools such as the MRSL.
Best available chemistries promoting innovation and development of better chemicals and technologies throughout the supply chain.
Restricted chemicals
We were one of the first in the industry to establish a Chemical Restrictions List in 1995 and we’ve been constantly updating it ever since. To make sure our products don’t contain these chemicals, we perform regular tests, which are mostly carried out by third-party laboratories.
Product safety
Our most vulnerable customer groups always come first in our product safety work, with stricter product chemical requirements for babies and children. This includes proactively eliminating hazardous chemicals. For example, we phased out PFAS and DMF ahead of regulatory mandates.
Input chemical compliance
We aim for 100% compliance with Zero Discharge of Hazardous Chemicals’ (ZDHC) Manufacturing Restricted Substances List (MRSL) across all chemical inputs and wastewater.
In 2024, we achieved 97% compliance of input chemicals in tier 1 and 2 production factories.
TRANSPARENT & COMPLIANT
NEED FURTHER INFORMATION
Wastewater compliance
For wastewater discharge, our suppliers are required to comply with ZDHC Wastewater Quality standards, which are often stricter than legal requirements, and to ensure effluent treatment plants are functioning correctly.
In 2024, we achieved 99.5% compliance.
% OF SUPPLIERS THAT ARE ZDHC MRSL COMPLIANT
Safer chemical alternatives
We share insights and best practices with industry partners to improve product safety, as well as supporting international safety standards through stakeholder dialogues.
Recycled materials and chemicals
Recycled materials are a key element in the circular economy, but increasing their use while keeping hazardous chemicals out of products and production presents a challenge. To tackle this, we initiated a collaborative study on recycled materials with IKEA to gain better knowledge and understanding of the potential risk of hazardous chemicals being present in recycled textiles. We are also deepening our understanding of recycled materials by considering the differences of various production countries and recycling methods such as mechanical and chemical recycling.

The general meeting is the company’s highest decision-making body and is the forum in which shareholders exercise their right to decide on the company’s affairs.
The ordinary general meeting (the annual general meeting) is held once a year in order to carry out tasks such as adopting the group’s annual report and accounts, discharging the members of the board of directors and the CEO from liability and deciding how the profit for the past financial year is to be allocated.
Extraordinary general meetings can be held where there is a particular need to do so.
H&M's annual general meeting 2025
H&M’s annual general meeting 2025 will be held on Wednesday 7 May 2025 at 15:00 CEST in the Erling Persson Hall, Aula Medica, Karolinska Institutet in Solna.
Due to the general security situation Karolinska Institutet has stated that bags will not be allowed to be taken into the meeting hall, with the exception of small handbags. Please bring ID.
Shareholders have the right to raise matters at the meeting provided that such request is received by the board of directors no later than 19 March 2025.

Transparency
Transparency is more important than ever. Demands to disclose information publicly in an honest and accountable way are increasing. At H&M Group, transparency means sharing clear, accurate and relevant information about our supply chain, our products, and our business standards and policies.
Being accountable.
We have been committed to increasing our level of transparency for many years. H&M was one of the first big brands to make its supplier list public in 2013 and we have continued to increase the amount of information we share ever since.
We believe transparency is key to driving sustainable change across our industry because it creates both comparability and accountability. Transparency empowers customers to make more informed purchasing decisions. It also empowers businesses, including ours, to make better-informed decisions that will improve sustainability performance and drive positive change.
There is still a long way to go, and the fashion industry is coming under greater scrutiny, but we are fully committed to our transparency work and the positive change it is creating.
Supply chain transparency
Supply-chain transparency is about disclosing the details of facilities involved in the manufacturing and production of garments.
Our supplier list, which was first published in 2013, maps and shares the details of our tier 1 suppliers, accounting for 99% of relevant production volume in 2022.
Information shared includes name, location, address and number of workers per facility. This information meets the standards for supply chain disclosure set out by Transparency Pledge, to which we aligned in 2017. We also share worker representation and gender breakdown data per facility.
We are continuously working to share more supplier information with the ambition to enable full supply-chain transparency.
Visit our supplier list
Product transparency
Product transparency means sharing information about how, where and what a product is made from.  It’s also about disclosing data relating to the environmental and social impact of a product.
In 2019, H&M became the largest global fashion retailer to share information detailing where products are made. This information is available at www.hm.com for H&M products and includes the name, address & location of the manufacturing factory, as well as material composition.
Traceability
Traceability means the ability to track the origin or location of our materials and products, and to connect this to the relevant data. While, supply chain transparency is sharing this information publicly. Both traceability and transparency are vital components of a responsible and sustainable value chain. This is why we have clear routines and procedures that help us verify our materials to make sure they meet our sustainability policies. 
Improving traceability
Increasing the visibility of our supply chain is an ongoing priority. We need to enhance our understanding of suppliers and to gather data that will give us traceability from raw material through to manufacturing.
To keep evolving our traceability, we need to both build our own capabilities and collaborate. We can have greater impact by working together within, and across, industries to come up with shared solutions.
TextileGenesis™
Since the first pilot in 2020, we have been using Textile Genesis’ blockchain technology to trace man-made cellulosic and recycled polyester fibers. This innovative approach ensures full transparency and traceability throughout the supply chain, from raw material sourcing to final product delivery, allowing us to record and verify each step of the fibre’s journey.
Textile Exchange
We’ve worked with Textile Exchange for many years, piloting new traceability and technology innovations. This includes using textile standards like the Global Recycled Standard, Recycled Content Standard, Organic Content Standard and Responsible Animal Fibers. We also take part in joint projects across the industry, helping shape the Textile Exchange technology roadmap, including tools like eTrackit.
Better Cotton
Better Cotton helps growers convert to farming practices that bring longer lasting economic, environmental and social benefits. Since 2021, we have been part of their Retailer and Brand Traceability Panel, a collective of companies working towards making Better Cotton traceable and ensuring farmers and their communities can continue to access increasingly regulated markets. The current focus is on driving demand for traceable Better Cotton and enhancing technical traceability solutions.
Standards and policies
Disclosure of our business standards and policies is vital to our transparency work. It enables open access to the rules and regulations that we adhere to, ensuring that we operate our business in the right way for people and the planet.
Sharing information about business standards and policies creates accountability and drives responsibility.
Find out more about our Standards & Policies.
We publish our sustainability progress report annually. In this document, we set out our goals and the progress we’ve made in the previous year. Find the latest version here. More up to date information can be included on this page.

H&M’s tax policy in brief
H&M always aims to be tax compliant and our tax policy reflects and supports our business. All taxes and charges are paid according to local laws and regulations in the countries where H&M operates. As a good corporate citizen H&M sees tax as an important part of its social responsibility.
Over the years H&M has applied a conservative and cautious tax policy. H&M complies with the OECD Transfer Pricing guidelines, which means that the profits are allocated and taxed where the value is created. The tax policy aims at a sustainable tax rate for the H&M group as a whole and the individual countries as such. Details of the miscellaneous jurisdictions’ tax positions are made available in country-by-country reporting as communicated with tax authorities around the globe. The H&M goup has been successfully compliant with its tax policy for the financial year 2022.
For all intercompany transactions, therein any dividend transaction that might have taken place, H&M complies and subscribes to the Anti-Hybrid Rules and their workings as they are designed to eliminate the use of hybrid mismatch arrangements that exploit differences in the tax treatment of an entity or instrument under the laws of two or more tax jurisdictions. H&M reframes the use of hybrid mismatches that result in double non-taxation or deductions without inclusion.
The overall aim of our tax policy is to reflect and support our business by ensuring a sustainable tax rate, mitigating tax risks in a timely and cost efficient way and complying with rules and regulations in the jurisdictions in which H&M operates. The H&M group complies with the Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS) principles and does not shift its income or profits between jurisdictions in a manufactured way, or abuse low-tax or secrecy jurisdictions (tax havens) to gain any tax or financial secrecy benefits.
H&M is present in many countries and by its presence contributes to society through various taxes and charges such as corporate tax, duties, payroll taxes and also indirectly through VAT levied on garments sold to customers. The H&M group works continually to ensure that its tax strategy is designed to limit any distortion arising from differences in tax legislation in different parts of the world. The company is committing to operate not just within the letter of the law, but also within the spirit of all tax laws that apply to the group’s operations – therefore carrying out tax planning commercially and not aggressively or in a manufactured way; and only claiming tax reliefs that the group is entitled to and in the way, they were intended to be claimed.
  Total tax level for the H&M Group
H & M Hennes & Mauritz AB is a Swedish company, listed on the Swedish Stock Exchange (Nasdaq Stockholm). H&M applies International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the EU.
The H&M group’s total tax rate is a result of the reported profits of H&M’s various subsidiaries and the effective corporate tax rates in each country, which vary from country to country. H&M aims to pay the right amount of tax in the right country. . For each subsidiary the tax residence is the same as its place of domicile, no subsidiary is tax resident in more than one jurisdiction.
H&M’s total tax rate is higher than the Swedish corporate tax rate which currently is 20.6 from January 1, 2021. For detailed information about H&M’s tax rate please see the Annual Report.
H&M’s transfer pricing model in line with the international transfer pricing guidelines
The general underlying aim is that profits should be taxed where the value is created in accordance with the OECD and UN guidelines on transfer pricing.
H&M works with a highly integrated business model whereby the design, assortment planning and logistics and marketing functions are gathered into a separate company, H & M Hennes & Mauritz GBC AB (Sweden). For example, since H&M’s own design and assortment function creates the collections centrally in Sweden, the value for these functions is allocated to Sweden.
The procurement and sourcing function is located in Hong Kong SAR and operates as the group’s central procurement and buying agent function. Since Hong Kong SAR had been handling the group’s procurements in Asia since 1978, it was natural to continue to use and to further strengthen Hong Kong SAR as the central hub for all H&M’s procurements representative offices worldwide.
Together with external advisors, H&M has analysed where the main value is created within the group. In H&M’s case the value created is split between a) the central functions in Sweden, b) the procurement and buying agent function in Hong Kong SAR and c) the sales countries. The analysis shows that most of the value of the group is created in Sweden and should thus be taxed there. The above constitutes the foundation of H&M’s transfer pricing model for all inter-company transactions.
H&M’s transfer pricing model is in line with the International Transfer Pricing Guidelines. H&M also follows the local regulations of the country in which the relevant subsidiary is located when determining the prices of its inter-company transactions. H&M conducts its inter-company transactions at arm’s length and has implemented transfer pricing documentation to support the transfer pricing methods applied. The whereabouts of the main business activity for each subsidiary, by the country-by-country reporting definition of activities, can be found as an enclosure to this Tax policy.
H&M applies the arm’s length principle to ensure that parties to the intra-group transactions are appropriately remunerated, that the transfer pricing methods are consistently applied, that accountability and transparency of transactions are ensured and that performance management is enhanced.
Transfer pricing documentation: H&M prepares transfer pricing documentation for its various inter-company transactions in order to meet the local transfer pricing documentation requirements of the countries in which the subsidiaries are located.
Governance: The global tax function at H&M has sole responsibility for initiating and documenting policies and guidelines for specific tax matters in the group. This tax policy has been discussed and reviewed by the Auditing Committee and thereafter approved by the Board of Directors. The quality management system for direct taxation and transfer pricing of H&M Hennes & Mauritz GBC AB was assessed and registered by DNV – business assurance, as confirming the requirements of SS-EN ISO 9001:2015 certificate for the period October 2022 to October 2025. (certificate number C534747)
Tax risks and external advisors
H&M pays its taxes at the appropriate times and provides any relevant information requested by the appropriate tax authority without delay in order to accurately establish the company’s tax liabilities.
H&M strives for good professional and transparent relationships with the tax authorities. H&M adheres to local rules and regulations on documentation retention requirements. H&M therefore always documents its communications with the tax authorities, which are logged in a separate e-room.
As a minimum, each tax-paying entity within the H&M group should document and retain all information required to determine the taxable amount and related taxation, such as accounting workbooks and sheets, files and other documentation.
H&M contributes by creating jobs as well as by paying direct and indirect taxes and other charges in the production countries
H&M does not own any factories but instead buys its products from independent suppliers in production countries located mainly in Asia and Europe. As H&M buys large volumes of garments and other related products in these countries, H&M contributes by creating jobs for many people. For many countries, these jobs, created by companies within the clothing industry such as H&M, spark further industrial development and help to lift individuals and nations out of poverty.
As mentioned earlier, for many years the value creation for H&M’s production has been located at H&M’s procurement and sourcing office in Hong Kong SAR, which sets the buying-strategies for the group’s procurement and has also the task of working on strategic matters relating to control and monitoring of H&M’s Code of Conduct, replaced by the Sustainability Commitment in February 2016. Like many other international groups, H&M has chosen to carry on its business through representative offices in other countries. H&M thus has a number of local representative procurement offices in the production countries which have the task of coordinating the procurement orders with the local manufacturers on behalf of the Hong Kong SAR office. As these representative offices only coordinate purchases, they are not considered to be permanent establishments. H&M accordingly has no trading activity that creates business income and is therefore not in a position to pay corporate income tax in the countries where the representative offices are located. H&M’s representative offices worldwide are organised under the group’s procurement company in Hong Kong SAR, where relevant tax is also paid.
However, tax revenues other than corporate tax are generated in the production countries. H&M’s employees at the local representative offices pay income tax and social security payments. VAT is also paid on products and services purchased by H&M’s representative offices.
H&M also contributes other fees such as duties and environmental levies in countries where these are applicable.
Definitions
Arm’s length principle: According to the arm’s length principle, companies within a multinational group should act as if they are independent of each other, i.e. “at arm’s length”. The international standard that OECD member countries have agreed should be used for determining transfer prices for tax purposes. It is set out in Article 9 of the OECD Model Tax Convention as follows: where “conditions are made or imposed between the two enterprises in their commercial or financial relations which differ from those which would be made between independent enterprises, then any profits which would, but for those conditions, have accrued to one of the enterprises, but, by reason of those conditions, have not so accrued, may be included in the profits of that enterprise and taxed accordingly”.
Facts about the OECD: The mission of the OECD (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development) is to promote policies that will improve the economic and social well-being of people around the world. The OECD provides a forum in which governments can work together to share experiences and seek solutions to common problems. The OECD works with governments to understand what drives economic, social, and environmental change. The OECD measures productivity and global flows of trade and investment and analyses and compares data to predict future trends. The OECD sets international standards on a wide range of things, from agriculture and tax to the safety of chemicals.
The OECD Transfer Pricing Guidelines aim to give each country a fair share of a company’s profit under the arm’s length standard as well as protecting companies from double taxation. According to the OECD guidelines, companies within a multinational group should act as if they are independent of each other.
The OECD is presently reviewing part of its Transfer Pricing Guidelines under the G20 “Base Erosion and Profit Shifting” project. For example, new guidance has been published on transfer pricing documentation, including new and more detailed documentation requirements.
The International Chamber of Commerce (ICC) has worked hard in close partnership with organisations such as the OECD and the UN to ensure that the transfer pricing rules are as fair as possible and that no individual countries attempt to circumvent the guidelines drawn up within the OECD by means of local legislation. The issue of when a taxable activity arises (fixed place of business) has also been carefully investigated and elucidated over a number of years. The current practice is recognised and accepted by most countries and legislators around the world.
United Nations (UN): The United Nations Practical Manual on Transfer Pricing for Developing Countries is a response to the need, often expressed by developing countries, for clearer guidance on the policy and administrative aspects of applying transfer pricing analysis to some of the transactions of multinational enterprises (MNEs) in particular. Such guidance should not only assist policy makers and administrators in dealing with complex transfer pricing issues, but should also assist taxpayers in their dealings with tax administrations.

Microfibres
H&M Group is highly concerned about the environmental impact of microfibres and is supporting research to find industry-wide solutions.
The challenge
When fabrics are washed, either during production or by customers, natural and synthetic microfibres are released into the water system. These fibres end up in waterways and pollute ecosystems.
We still have a lot to learn about microfibres. For example, a full understanding of how yarn and fabric constructions as well as production processes contribute to the problem so effective solutions can be found.
There is also an urgent need for more research and a better understanding of the adverse effects of microfibres on humans and the environment. This will give the industry a better perspective on the relevant issues and how they correlate to, for example, fibre content or type of finish.
Our approach to microfibres
Microfibres need to be addressed at several stages throughout our value chain, including design, production, use and end-of-life, which is why we cooperate with other stakeholders to find effective solutions.
We’re developing a microfibres roadmap to formalise our current approach, which includes:
Sharing knowledge and information about microfibres across our supply chain to raise awareness and identify potential solutions.
Choosing and designing yarns and fabrics that minimise microfibre shedding.
Researching new production processes and requirements to minimise shedding.
Offering microplastic-reducing laundry bags to customers and supporting the development of laundry machine filter systems.
Improving technologies that enable reuse and recycling.
Projects and activities
The Microfibre 2030 Commitment
We signed up to The Microfibre 2030 Commitment – a global commitment to work towards zero impact on nature from textile fibre fragmentation by 2030. In 2023, we participated in the first progress report and we shared our test results on fibre fragmentation at a fabric level for their industry database. We are designing our roadmap to be in line with this commitment.
Management Tool for Microplastics
We initiated a 24-month research project called ‘A Management Tool for Microplastics from Textile Production Process’, together with the Hong Kong Research Institute of Textiles and Apparel (HKRITA). The project closely studies the release of microplastics and their management in textile manufacturing processes.
Using soundwaves to recover microplastics
H&M Foundation (a privately funded foundation that aims to accelerate solutions towards a socially inclusive and planet positive textile industry) is supporting a project at HKRITA using sweeping acoustic waves in a specially shaped chamber to trap and recover microplastic fibres. Unlike existing filtration processes, Acousweep enables continuous water treatment and easy collection of microplastic fibres.
Using bacteria to break down microplastics
Another HKRITA project supported by H&M Foundation aims to identify and develop a microbial consortium, a group of diverse bacteria working together, to degrade microplastic. It focuses on the removal of microplastic released from textile waste.
Tackling Microfibres at Source
Our research work with Forum for Future showed that certain production processes that involve more force, such as conventional dying and washing, can result in more fibre shedding. It also showed that all materials shed a similar amount of microfibres. The project culminated in a report called “Tackling Microfibres at Source”, which was published in February 2023. It shares findings and recommendations of actions the fashion industry can take to reduce microfibre pollution.

Vision and strategy
From our very first day in 1947, our business has been about making fashion and the joy it can bring accessible to everyone — democratising what had previously been a privilege of the few.
Lead the change
Scale innovation
Promote transparency
Collaborate for industrywide progress
Support a circular fashion industry with net-zero climate impact
Become net-zero across our value chain by 2040, operating within planetary boundaries
Have a net-positive impact on biodiversity
Scale circular models and systems for our products, supply chains and customer journeys
Be a fair and equal company
Have a positive impact on people across our value chain
Support and promote inclusion and diversity in everything we do
Respect human rights
Today, the world looks different, but one thing remains the same – people want to enjoy fashion and we want to make fashion accessible for all. Our sustainability work brings us opportunities to grow in innovative ways and to develop our customer offering so we keep meeting and exceeding their expectations.  
To make the most of these opportunities, we challenge ourselves, question old assumptions and look for new ways to do business that decouples our growth from the use of finite natural resources. We invest in new materials, technology and business models to drive change in the way we make and remake our products, and how our customers can experience fashion and design. 
From the resources we use and reuse, to how we work with people and the expectations we set for our suppliers, everything we do forms part of the social and environmental story of our products. We want to enable our customers to understand and be part of that story, so they can make informed choices and ultimately see more sustainable choices as the most desirable and attractive ones. 
Our industry is redefining itself and evolving, and so are we. We’ve been working on the sustainability of our business for more than 20 years, refining and reiterating our approach to address new challenges and take on board new knowledge. And we’re committed to keep learning, investing and taking action.

Circularity and climate
We are moving towards a circular economy, where resources are kept in use for as long as possible, to decouple our growth from resource use.
Our ambition is to achieve net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2040, reduce our absolute water consumption, secure wastewater quality and contribute to the global goal to have a positive impact on nature.
KEY SUSTAINABILITY GOALS
Focus areas
We’re cutting emissions across our business and our supply chain through energy saving measures and switching to renewables. Find out more about our journey to reach net-zero by 2040.
CLIMATE
We are reducing the amount of water we use to make our products. We also work with communities and other organisations to improve water quality and availability on a landscape scale.
WATER
Biodiversity is crucial for the health of our planet and our business. We support projects that protect and restore the natural world and are connected to the materials we use.
BIODIVERSITY
From the way we design our products to the services we offer our customers, we are committed to moving away from a take-make-waste approach to fashion. Instead we are building systems to make sure products and materials are used again and again.
CIRCULARITY
Whether they are natural or synthetic, we choose the materials we use in our products carefully. Our aim is to always source recycled, regenerative or responsible alternatives, to minimise our impact on people and the planet.
MATERIALS
We’re getting rid of unnecessary packaging, switching to recycled materials and investigating reusable solutions.

Risk management
H&M Group has an entrepreneurial approach to business development. Launching new initiatives and ventures makes it necessary to accept a degree of business risk, while presenting many opportunities. H&M Group carries out regular risk assessments for both operational and financial risks. Financial risks are related to the use of economic funds and financial resources and include foreign currency fluctuations, taxes and various regulations and ordinances. Operational risks mainly comprise internal business risks and external events which may affect the group. During 2023 a number of external risks and uncertainties were identified and handled within the company’s risk management processes.
The H&M group’s overall approach to risk management and internal control is described on page 14 and onwards in the corporate governance report, which can be found as a separate document here.

Human rights
Our business is all about people. Respecting human rights is essential for us to operate successfully and is closely aligned with our values.
We recognise that we have a responsibility, and an opportunity, to ensure people within our operations and across our supply chains are treated equally, with respect and dignity, wherever or whoever they are.
From our colleagues in our stores and the customers they greet each day, to the garment workers employed by our suppliers and the farmers who grow the cotton used in our products, everyone is entitled to the same human rights.
What are human rights?
Human rights are rights we have because we exist as human beings. These universal rights are inherent to us all, regardless of nationality, sex, national or ethnic origin, colour, religion, language, or any other status.  
Human rights range from the most fundamental – the right to life – to those that make life worth living, such as the right to food, education, work and health. They include the right to good working conditions, freedom from slavery and torture, freedom of opinion and expression, and many more. Everyone is entitled to these rights, without discrimination and indepently of where you live or work
We follow the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, a standard for responsible business conduct that gives clear guidance for companies on how to uphold human rights within their operations and across their supply chains. 
Our Human Rights Work
Our human rights policy guides our work and sets out our commitment to operate with respect to human rights.
Due to the nature of our business, we focus primarily on working conditions of colleagues in our operations and workers in our global manufacturing supply chains. Our salient issues inform our priorities. As well as general labour rights, wages and modern slavery, they cover topics such as access to water and sanitation, reflecting impacts we may have on communities.
We follow a risk-based approach to due diligence and adjust our actions accordingly across our value chain. This includes policy development and integration, strengthening of grievance mechanisms, training and capacity building, strategy development, collaborations in industry initiatives, and other ways to manage risk.
Although we do not employ the garment workers who make our clothes, it is our responsibility to ensure they have safe, fair and equal working conditions. We’ve been working with our manufacturing suppliers for many years to make sure they comply with international labour standards and, in 1997, we launched our first Code of Conduct and supplier audit program. Today, our approach to supply chain management has a big focus on collaborations and continuous improvement.
We also want to find ways to advance human rights through the way we do business. For example, through our work with suppliers to advance gender equality in our manufacturing supply chain or our focus on inclusion & diversity within our operations.
As a global company with strong values, we can have a positive impact around the world, which in turn allows us to remain a sustainable business and to grow in meaningful ways that make a real difference to people across our value chain.
Read more here about our approach to human rights management.

Content:
Raise a concern
We make every effort to conduct our business in an ethical and fair way. Trust and respect amongst our employees, business partners, investors and other stakeholders is key. Our policies and guidelines set out expected behavior and we have procedures to address any alleged misconduct. 
At H&M Group, we take any allegation of misconduct in our business seriously. Misconduct can include discrimination, harassment, theft, fraud, corruption, other violations of our policies and guidelines regarding ethical behavior, or violation of laws.
Early reporting is essential and can help resolve an issue quickly. It can also minimise any harm. All reports are investigated and appropriate actions are taken against proven misconduct.
People should feel safe and supported when they raise a concern and we make every effort to keep their identity strictly confidential. Reports may be made anonymously, except in countries where this does not comply with local laws, and we do not tolerate retaliation against anyone who raises a concern in good faith.
Speak Up channel
If somebody suspects an abuse of trust or suspected misconduct within our organisation, local processes should always be followed first. If this is not possible, our secure Speak Up channel is available to our employees, business partners and their employees, as well as other third parties. See below for more information about our process for internal reporting and expectations of our business partners.
Speak Up channel
Our Speak Up channel is hosted by an external partner and available 24/7 in multiple languages.
RAISE A CONCERN
What to expect when you use Speak Up
All concerns are taken seriously.
You will be treated with dignity and respect.
Anybody who reports a case will remain anonymous, where local law permits.
All communication is strictly confidential.
Speak Up automatically shares your case with an H&M Group colleague responsible for the category of incident or concern. For better handling, your report may be forwarded to a designated local investigator.
Your case is given an incident number and you may be contacted via the platform for more information related to the case.
We handle all cases according to our internal investigatory procedures.
You can see the status of the case at any time during the investigation.
We do not tolerate retaliation for reporting suspected misconduct in good faith.
  Reporting processes
Internal grievances
Being straight forward is one of our values. That’s why we have an open-door policy to encourage all employees to openly discuss any work-related issue or concern, including suspected misconduct, directly with their managers. If discussing the matter with the manager is not possible, employees can contact their designated HR contact or a senior manager.
Our Speak Up channel offers employees an alternative option for reporting misconduct.
Business partners and their employees
All suppliers must sign our Sustainability Commitment and Code of Ethics, which set out our expectations for the relationship including that every employee is always treated with dignity and respect.
We also expect our business partners to establish their own misconduct reporting process, where their employees can report complaints and concerns without fear of retaliation. However, if a business partner employee cannot raise their concern within their own organisation, or sees no action on a concern that affects the H&M Group, they may use our Speak Up channel. This is in line with OECD Due Diligence Guidance for Responsible Business Conduct and local legislation where we operate.
Whistleblowing
Any other serious malpractice against H&M Group’s vital interests may also be addressed through the Speak Up channel. These cases can be reported by anyone, inside or outside the H&M Group. Examples of such malpractice include bribery, accounting fraud, auditing matters, financial crimes and environmental crimes.

Biodiversity
Biodiversity is all the different kinds of life on our planet. These species and organisms work together to support everything we need to survive, and to build a resilient business. But fashion impacts biodiversity at every stage of its value chain.
Why we work with biodiversity and nature
Biodiversity loss is recognised as one of the biggest challenges of our time. In WWF’s Living Planet Report 2024, it states that wildlife populations have declined on average by 73% since 1970. Immediate action is needed to reverse this trend. The link between biodiversity, nature and business is well established and according to the World Economic Forum, biodiversity loss is the third biggest risk businesses face.
At H&M Group, every stage of our value chain affects the natural planet and the biggest impact comes from sourcing raw materials. At the same time, we are dependent on biodiversity for fertile soil, robust forests, quality air and water, as well as healthy pollinators to produce natural materials for our products.
Our ambition
We want to move away from business practices that harm ecosystems and biodiversity. Our work focuses on reducing greenhouse gas emissions, limiting hazardous chemical discharge, addressing shared water and soil challenges, halting ecosystem conversation and minimising land use for production.
We aim to build a resilient value chain that supports global biodiversity goals and aligns with the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework. By working with partners like IDH, Laudes Foundation, WWF, Better Cotton, The Fashion Pact, NATIVA and LEAF, we amplify our impact through shared resources.
Our work on biodiversity is guided by the ARRRT framework that sets actions in a priority order:
1. Avoid
Recirculating existing products through circular business models and using artificial intelligence to match supply to demand help us avoid negative impacts on biodiversity.
2. Reduce
We are reducing our impact by increasing the recycled content of our products and using greater amounts of certified materials such as Responsible Wool and wood from FSC certified forests.
3. Restore & regenerate
Regenerative agriculture and conservation projects help to restore natural habitats and increase the resilience of nature.
4. Transform
Through collaborating with others, we bring about transformation change to the fashion industry.
Science based targets for nature
In 2023, we completed a SBTN pilot assessing our value chain and the target setting process for land and water. As part of the project, we assessed three land targets – preventing ecosystem conversion, reducing land footprint, and engaging in landscape initiatives.
As a result of the pilot, which aims to standardise how businesses measure environmental impact and define targets, we identified key industry challenges, such as the need for better data. We also confirmed that cotton sourcing in India and wool sourcing in South Africa remain priorities. Our of our WWF-led projects – cotton farming in Madhya Pradesh, India and sheep grazing in Eastern Cape, South Africa – were submitted to SBTN as part of the pilot.

Our biodiversity and nature projects
We are investing in projects connected to the parts of our value chain where we have the biggest environmental impact – raw materials. 
Cotton and wool are two important materials we use to make our products. Conventional production methods can lead to negative impacts like soil erosion, pollution and overgrazing. Therefore, we support regenerative agriculture projects, which focus on the links between nature and farming to improve soil health and biodiversity, strengthen the resilience of farmers and communities, reduce our impact and increase the availability of regenerative materials.
Supporting cotton farmers in Madhya Pradesh
In Madhya Pradesh state, India, we are working with Laudes Foundation, IDH The Sustainable Trade Initiative, and WWF India to support smallholder farms to transition to regenerative practices. The project aims to move farmers to a multi-commodity supply chain and build community resilience through systemic change driven by local ownership and governance.
Regenerative cotton farming in a wildlife corridor
In partnership with WWF, we are working with smallholder cotton farmers to introduce regenerative farming practices, support livelihoods and protect a corridor for tigers and other wildlife in Satpura Pench, India. The first harvest season brought lower pest populations and lower costs compared to conventional farming. Find out more and watch a film here.
Developing a model for smallholder farming
We joined a project with the Better Cotton Growth & Innovation fund and WWF India, which aims to develop a regenerative agriculture model for smallholder farms that can be replicated in other areas. It prioritises easy to adopt practices that have an immediate effect on soil health such as using organic compost and biological alternatives to synthetic fungicides.
Supporting the transition in Argentina
In 2023, we joined a project with NATIVA™ to support sheep farmers transitioning to regenerative practices in Argentina. NATIVA selected the farms and expert organisations that will be involved in the on farm implementation and baseline analysis, which will begin next year.
Regenerative sheep farming in South Africa
Eastern Cape Drakensberg is a haven for biodiversity and an important water catchment area. We are working with WWF on a project to encourage local sheep farmers to adopt more regenerative grazing practices. Read more here.
Forest restoration and rattan production in Indonesia
In 2023, we initiated a project with WWF to restore and enrich forest cover, as well as improve rattan farmers livelihoods in Central Kalimantan.

A collaborative effort
Halting and reversing the decline in biodiversity and nature needs a collaborative approach. Working with partners and through cross-industry collaboration will accelerate change. Here are some of the organisations we work with and how we are taking action together:
In the run up to COP15, we joined Business for Nature’s (B4N) Make it Mandatory campaign, calling on negotiators to make assessment and disclosure about impacts on nature compulsory. We are also part of B4N’s Strategic Advisory Group.
We have worked with WWF for over a decade, collaborating to address our environmental impact. As part of the partnership, we provide funding and advisory input to the Biodiversity Stewardship Programme.
As part of our Fashion Pact membership, we participated in the have mapped the Transforming the Fashion Sector project analysing the land, biodiversity and ecosystem impacts of our leather supply chain in line with the SBTN framework.
We contributed to an Ellen MacArthur Foundation study on how the circular economy can tackle biodiversity loss.
We publish our sustainability progress report annually. In this document, we set out our goals and the progress we’ve made in the previous year. Find the latest version here. More up to date information can be included on this page.

Animal welfare
Animal welfare is important to us and no animals should be harmed in the making of our products. We have a long-standing commitment to improving animal welfare across our global supply chain and we are working to source all animal-derived materials from certified farms with improved animal welfare practices in place.
Our Approach
Our ambition is to only source animal fibres from farms which have been certified, as set out in our Animal Welfare Policy.   
None of our beauty products are tested on animals and we have strict requirements in place for materials of animal origin, such as wool, leather or down. We say a big no to fur, and for many years we have banned the use of exotic skin, as well as any material deriving from endangered species. We have not used angora wool since 2013 and since 2020, we only source mohair from farms certified to the Responsible Mohair Standard.  
While cashmere is popular for its soft texture and known as a high-quality material, it comes with both environmental and animal welfare challenges. Therefore, we aim to source all virgin cashmere from farms certified to the Good Cashmere Standard (GCS). In 2024, 100% came from GCS certified farms. 
In line with our ambition to reduce our dependency on virgin resources, we aim to increase our share of recycled animal fibres. We are also exploring alternative materials that can offer the same qualities as those from animals.
We have long-term goals in place for all materials of animal origin: 
We aim to source all our animal fibres from responsible farms certified to animal welfare standards by 2025 at the latest: 
Virgin wool should be sourced from farms certified to the Responsible Wool Standard. 
Virgin cashmere should be sourced from farms certified to the Good Cashmere Standard.  
Alpaca wool should be sourced from farms certified to the Responsible Alpaca Standard.  
All mohair should be sourced from farms certified to the Responsible Mohair Standard.  
Since 2015, we only source virgin down from farms that are certified according to the Responsible Down Standard. 
We aim to source only recycled, post-consumer down and feathers by the end of 2025.
Working Together for Change
To raise the level of animal welfare, we team up with different stakeholders. Through our work with industry experts, we support research, development and implementation of animal welfare standards and transparency for wool, cashmere, leather and down. 
We support organisations such as  Textile Exchange and campaigns like Humane Society International’s Be Cruelty Free, which aim to improve animal welfare and achieve a global ban on animal testing for beauty products. We believe animals have the right to fair treatment and have their basic needs fulfilled.

Materials
Raw material production can be harmful to people and planet. We make every effort to ensure that the materials in our products are sourced more responsibly and leave a lighter footprint.
How we work with materials
All materials have an impact on climate, nature and people - from production, through the use stage and to the end of life. To reduce this impact, we aim for 100% of our materials to be either recycled or sustainably sourced by 2030, and 30% recycled materials by 2025.
In 2024, we increased the amount of recycled materials in our products to 29.5%, which we hope to double to 50% by 2030, and the share of recycled or sustainably sourced materials to 89%, making good progress towards our goals.1 
Our definition of “recycled and sustainably sourced materials” has evolved from evaluating a material’s environmental factors compared to conventional alternatives, to taking a more holistic approach that also includes social factors. We are working towards aligning our definition with Textile Exchange’s definition of preferred fibre and materials. Read more here.
Our material vision
We take a progressive approach to our material work, continually evaluating the materials sourced for our products to reflect the latest science, best practices, and knowledge. This ensures we can respond to changes caused by global events, societal and environmental change.
Our vision is to move towards more resilient and circular raw materials that stay within planetary boundaries, enhances livelihoods, and thrives on innovation. It is built around three pillars:
Recycled
In our journey to build a circular ecosystem where products and materials are circulated at their highest value, we need to reduce our dependency on virgin fibres. By doing this, we will reduce our negative impact on climate, nature and communities, and help to meet our environmental goals and ambitions. In an ideal world, these recycled fibres would come from used textiles to create a closed loop. However, we need to build global infrastructure for collecting and sorting used garments, as well as scale up recycling technology to guarantee an adequate supply of recycled fibres. In the meantime, pre-consumer feedstock, for example from offcuts and scraps generated during production, can make up the shortfall.
Regenerative
As part of our materials vision, key virgin raw materials should be produced using regenerative agricultural practices. Crop rotation, cover cropping, minimal or no-tilling, as well as the use of natural fertilisers all help improve soil health. The soil can then store more carbon and retain water more efficiently. Plus healthier soils create healthier crops that need less inputs like pesticides or synthetic fertilisers. All of this positively impact biodiversity and farmer livelihood long-term. Find out more about the regenerative agriculture projects we are investing in.
Responsible
Making sure materials are sourced responsibly is the foundation of our material vision. We have a risk-based approach that is based on OECD guidelines for Responsible Business Conduct and the UN Guiding Principle on Business and Human Rights.  All raw materials in our products should be produced in a way that respects human rights, preserves natural resources, and ensures humane treatment of animals. Find out more about our approach to responsibly sourced materials.

Material standards and certifications
Voluntary standards and certifications are important tools that guide our raw material sourcing to minimize impact on both people and the planet. They promote sustainable practices, help protect workers and the environment, support customers in purchasing decisions and drive change in our industry.3
We use standards and certifications that:
are developed and maintained through multi-stakeholder processes involving organisations working on the environment, human and animal rights issues.
use a wide set of measurable indicators.
are aligned with the ISEAL’s  Code of Good Practice.
Investing in the materials of tomorrow
Innovative materials will play an important role in the fashion of the future and help us move away from using more resources to drive grow. Here are a selection of projects we have recently supported:
In 2024, we lauched Syre with Vargas Holdings. The company aims to scale textile-to-textile recycled polyester. We have also agreed an offtake agreement with Syre.
We invested in Galy, which uses biotechnology to produce cotton in a fast process that uses less water and no land, resulting in much lower greenhouse gas emissions.
H&M Group Ventures invested in Kintra Fibers. The company has developed a bio-based and biodegradable polyester and continues to be supported by our Circular Innovation Lab.
We invested in Rubi, a former Global Change Award winner, that produces manmade cellulosic fibres from industrial CO2 emissions.
We are working with Sparxell to test cellulosic based glitter and sequins to replace petroleum based products.
In 2022, we supported research from Karolinska Institutet and SLU (Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences) to scale production of a protein-based fibre that mimics spider silk.
Cotton
All our cotton is either recycled, organic, regenerative, in-conversion or sourced through Better Cotton. We are committed to keep exploring different cotton types and innovations to make sure we source the best possible alternatives.
Read more about the cotton we use.
Synthetics
Synthetics add functionality, comfort and durability to our clothes. Read more about the different types we use in our products and how we are moving towards recycled alternatives.
Read more about the synthetics we use.
Manmade cellulosics
We use several different manmade cellulosic fibres in our products, such as viscose. Traditionally derived from wood pulp, these materials are increasingly being made from waste or by-products of other industries.
Read more about our approach to MMCFs.
Microfibres
All fabrics shed microfibres. We are working with industry partners and other organisations to better understand the problem and research potential solutions.
Read more about our approach to Microfibres.
Leather
Although we only use a small amount of leather in our products, the material can have a substantial environmental and social impact. Find out how we source leather to try and reduce these risks.

Content:
Nomination committee
The nomination committee prepares information that will be used as a basis for decisions at the general meeting concerning election of the board of directors, the chairman of the board, the auditors and the chairman of the annual general meeting, fees to the board and auditors.
The nomination committee consists of:
Karl-Johan Persson, chair of the board
Stefan Persson, Ramsbury Invest
Lottie Tham
Anders Oscarsson, AMF Tjänstepension & AMF Fonder
Joachim Spetz, Swedbank Robur Fonder
The above composition of the nomination committee is based on the ownership structure as at the last banking day in August 2024 in accordance with the resolutions below concerning the instructions for and composition of the nomination committee that were adopted at the annual general meeting on 4 May 2022 and which remain in effect until a general meeting of shareholders decides otherwise.
Stefan Persson chairs the nomination committee.
A. COMPOSITION OF NOMINATION COMMITTEE
The nomination committee is to consist of the chair of the board and four other members. The four other members are to be appointed as follows: each of the four largest shareholders measured by voting power, according to the register of shareholders kept by Euroclear Sweden AB as at the last banking day in August each year, appoints a member. Determination of which are the four largest owners measured by voting power is to be based on shareholder statistics that are sorted by voting rights (in ownership groups) and include the 25 largest registered shareholders in Sweden, i.e. shareholders holding an account with Euroclear Sweden AB in their own name or shareholders holding a custody account with a manager that has given the name of the shareholder to Euroclear Sweden AB.
Unless the members of the nomination committee agree otherwise, the chair of the nomination committee is to be the member appointed by the largest owner measured by voting power. The chair of the committee will have the casting vote in the event that the votes are equal.
If any of the four largest shareholders measured by voting power declines to take part in the nomination committee, or can otherwise be assumed to have declined such a right, the next largest shareholder (measured by voting power) is to be given opportunity to appoint a member.
If a shareholder that nominated a member of the nomination committee notifies the nomination committee that this shareholder wishes the person it appointed to no longer be a member of the nomination committee (e.g. because the person concerned is no longer employed), the person concerned will no longer be a member of the nomination committee.
If a shareholder has appointed a member of the nomination committee but at a time no less than four months before the annual general meeting is no longer one of the four largest shareholders measured by voting power, the nomination committee can decide that the member appointed by this shareholder will no longer be a member of the nomination committee.
If a member leaves the nomination committee before its work is completed, a replacement is to be appointed if the nomination committee considers this appropriate (taking into consideration, for example, how much of the nomination committee’s work remains to be done). Such replacement member is to be appointed by the same shareholder as appointed the departing member or, if this shareholder is no longer one of the four largest shareholders measured by voting power, by the next largest shareholder.
H&M is to provide information on the company’s website concerning the composition of the nomination committee at least six months before each annual general meeting. The company is also to provide information there concerning changes in the composition of the nomination committee.
The terms owner and shareholder in expressions such as “the four largest owners measured by voting power” or “the next largest shareholder” refers to shareholders as recorded in the shareholder statistics stated in 1 above.
B. INSTRUCTIONS FOR THE NOMINATION COMMITTEE
As soon as possible after the last banking day in August each year, the chair of the board is to convene the nomination committee’s first meeting and, as part of the nomination committee’s work, is also to report to the nomination committee the circumstances relating to the board’s work and need for special expertise etc. that may be of significance for the nomination committee’s work.
No fees are to be paid to the members of the nomination committee. The nomination committee may charge to the company any reasonable costs for travel and investigations.
The nomination committee is to submit proposals to each annual general meeting for the following:
a) election of a chair for the meeting;
b) resolution on the number of board members;
c) resolution on board fees for the chair of the board and for each of the other members of the board (including work in board committees);
d) election of board members;
e) election of chair of the board;
f) resolution on the number of auditors;
g) resolution on fees to the auditor(s);
h) election of auditor(s).
All information that the members of the nomination committee receive within the context of their position on the committee or otherwise receive from the company is to be kept strictly confidential and must not be disclosed to third parties until the information has been made public. The nomination committee’s proposals, reports and statements are to be communicated to the company in reasonable time to ensure compliance with the Swedish Corporate Governance Code.
Proposals from shareholders for the nomination committee may be sent either to individual members of the nomination committee or directly to:
H & M Hennes & Mauritz AB
Valberedningen
106 38 Stockholm
email: valberedningen@hm.com
An account of the work of the nomination committee ahead of each AGM is available in a separate document on every nomination committee page, see below.

Business idea
There should be no compromise between exceptional design, affordable prices and sustainable solutions.
In 1947, our founder had a vision. Erling Persson wanted to make great fashion available to everyone and to do it in the right way. He built the foundation for a customer-focused, creative, value-driven and responsible company.
Our future depends on our strong culture of innovation and entrepreneurship, a tireless focus on our customers and the ability to scale great ideas to benefit millions.
Our business
We offer clothing, accessories, footwear, cosmetics, home textiles, homeware and other products through our brands: H&M, COS, Weekday, Cheap Monday, Monki, & Other Stories, ARKET, Singular Society and Sellpy. Our ventures, such as and Creator Studio, focus on building scalable solutions, creating value for customers and exploring new revenue streams.
Through our investment arm, H&M Group Ventures, we explore new business models and partnerships to enhance the customer experience and scale recycled and responsibly sourced materials. We also invest in start-ups like SRTX, Colorifix and Vestuá.
The customer in focus
Our customers guide everything we do. As their needs and preferences change, we work to meet them. We focus on improving their experience in every way—from designing products to connecting physical and online stores.
We believe everyone matters, and every person is unique. That’s why we build diverse teams. This helps us understand our customers better, offer relevant products, and support inclusion through our marketing and products.
Growing sustainably
H&M Group has a long history of actively working with sustainability. It is an integral part of what we do.
This means that each brand, retail market, production market and group function aims to grow our business in a way that decouples our financial growth from the use of finite natural resources.
The importance and value of our sustainability work for our business is further underlined in our 2030 goals, which combine targets for company growth and profit with greenhouse gas emissions reduction.

Climate
The science is clear – global temperature rise must be kept to 1.5°C – and as a global fashion company we have to act.
Degrees matter
The impacts of climate change are already being felt around the world and science shows that we need to keep global temperature rise to 1.5°C to secure a liveable future for our planet.1
At H&M Group, our goal is to reduce absolute greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions across our value chain by 56% by 2030 and by at least 90% by 2040 (against a 2019 baseline).2 We will also balance out the remaining 10% of unavoidable emissions to reach net-zero by 2040 through carbon dioxide removals. These goals were verified by the Science Based Targets Initiative (SBTI) in September 2022.3
What is net-zero?
Currently we cannot decrease our emissions 100% to achieve absolute zero. Instead, we need to take action to balance out any unavoidable, or residual, emissions to reach net-zero.3
We also have a series of supporting targets:
Reduce electricity consumption in stores per square metre and opening hour by 36% by 2030 against a 2016 baseline.
Source 100% renewable energy for our own operations, with at least half coming from power purchase agreements for new renewable electricity generation by 2030.
Source 100% renewable energy for our supply chain – from spinning to finished product by 2030.
Phase out coal from our garment supply chain by 2026.
The different areas of our sustainability work are linked and our work in one area can benefit another. Cutting our GHG emissions could also reduce our impact on water resources, help protect biodiversity and support human rights such as health, livelihoods, land rights and access to water.
However, focusing solely on our impact will not be enough. We need to take action beyond our value chain through investing in climate and nature projects, such as LEAF Coalition that provides financial support to protect tropical forests.
The whole picture
Our Climate Transition Plan brings together all our climate related activities from across our business into one document. It focuses on our journey towards 2030 and includes our targets, strategy and methodology as well as detailing our actions and the challenges we face. 
GET THE PLAN
Our report, Powering change: Our energy use 2024, outlines how we use energy in our operations and supply chain. It also shares our view on biomass, renewable electricity procurement and the shifts needed to reach our climate and energy goals.

How we're reaching net-zero
Address direct and indirect impact
Supporting our suppliers to save energy and switch to renewables
We have set up funding to support our suppliers to take energy efficiency measures and switch to greener energy. To date, the Green Fashion Initiative has supported 23 projects with the potential to reduce emissions in our supply chain by 148,000 tonnes CO2e. Of this, 67,000 tonnes are attributable to H&M Group.
Phasing out coal
In 2024, 27 of our tier 1 and 2 suppliers reported the use of on-site coal boilers, down from 118 units in 2022. This is due to our push to phase out coal and electrify steam, changes to our supplier base and local legislation. In 2024, we expanded traceability to include tier 3. This helped identify 12 more facilities using coal, bringing the total to 39. We have now set a goal to eliminate on-site coal boilers in our supply chain by the end of 2026.
Greener electricity in Europe
We’ve signed virtual power purchase agreements (PPAs) in the UK, Sweden, and Spain to source enough green electricity for almost all our operations in Europe.  We have also signed a PPA in the US.
Energy efficiency at our suppliers
In 2024, we enrolled 78 new facilities in our energy efficiency programme, identifying potential reductions of more than 656,000 tonnes CO2e. This brings the total of projects to 1027, with an expected annual reduction of 350,000 tonnes Co2e..
RE100 member company
RE100 brings together businesses that are committed to sourcing 100% electricity from renewable energy sources to accelerate the transition to a low-carbon economy by creating demand for renewable electricity, and to encourage governments to increase their ambition to deliver renewable energy.
Contribute to addressing impact
Carbon dioxide removal
Current options for permanent carbon dioxide removal are limited. By investing now, we can help scale solutions so more organisations can access them in the future. In 2022, we signed a multi-year deal with Climeworks for direct air capture and storage. In 2023, we joined Frontier and have since signed twelve offtake agreements to buy permanent carbon removals when they are delivered.
Protecting carbon sinks
Our partnership with LEAF Coalition works towards protecting tropical forests, an important existing carbon sink. In 2024, we signed an agreement along with other LEAF buyers to purchase five million emissions reduction credits from the Brazilian state of Pará. 
Advocate for system change
Promoting policy
We advocate for legislation that supports decarbonisation of our value chain. In 2024, we signed the World Economic Forum’s (WEF) COP 29 open letter and we joined the University of Cambridge Institue for Sustainability Leadership’s Corporate Leaders Group Europe.
Renewable energy access
In our main retail and production markets we work with policymakers and stakeholder platforms, such as the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change Fashion Charter, WEF and RE100, to improve the availability of renewable energy.
Carbon offsetting or carbon compensation
When the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) suggested they would allow companies to use voluntary carbon markets to offset scope 3 emissions we wrote to the Board of Trustees at SBTi to raise our concerns about this statement. Read the letter.
Holistic partnership
We have worked with WWF for many years. The partnership covers climate, water and biodiversity. Find out more here.
Financing emission reductions
Our green investments direct funding towards initiatives like these that will help us reduce emissions and reach our goals. The return on these investments is measure in GHG emissions reduction, not in financial gain.
The role of biomass energy
Factories in the textile supply chain often rely on thermal energy generated by burning fossil fuels. Our priority is to work with our suppliers to move away from this practice by electrifying their factories and, at the same time, switching to renewable electricity. However, a lack of access to renewable sources and unreliable local electricity grids can slow down this transition. Therefore, certain types of biomass can act as a stop-gap solution. Read more about how we’re working with biomass. 
The sustainability risks of different biomass feedstocks can vary greatly. We help our suppliers to select the biomass fuel type with the lowest possible risk. This support builds on the biomass tools and guidelines from the Institute of Sustainable Communities.
1 The agreement to keep temperature rise was agreed in the Paris Agreement, a legally binding international treaty on climate change.
2 For more information about our goals and the progress we’ve made, see our sustainability progress report. 
3 Net-zero as defined by SBTi’s Net-Zero Standard
We publish our sustainability progress report annually. In this document, we set out our goals and the progress we’ve made in the previous year. Find the latest version here. More up to date information can be included on this page.

Green investment
Financing the transition to a low carbon textile industry
The challenge
To achieve net-zero we need to invest. Switching to renewable energy, introducing energy efficiency measures and swapping to lower impact processes all cost money. But projects like these often have a long-term payback period and frequently get relegated to the bottom of the list.
The problem is, we can’t wait. We need to find ways to make these investments happen now.
Our approach
Our green investments are designed to speed up decarbonisation of our business. They bridge the gap between business goals and climate ambitions, bringing financing for projects with long payback periods within reach.
The majority of the funding is directed towards fabric production, a resource-intensive process. The first step is to introduce energy efficiency measures. Then we look at electrifying those factories where steam is used to power equipment or processes, while at the same time switching to renewables where possible. Other projects we support include developing low impact materials, decarbonising logistics and activities that promote circularity.
We have developed a range of solutions to target our suppliers’ different needs. Together, they create an ecosystem of support that drives down emissions in a cost-effective way.
H&M Group programmes
Our in-house funding programmes target different parts of the decarbonisation journey:
Green Fashion Initiative (GFI)
Limited technical expertise, restricted access to finance, high interest rates and low returns on investment are common barriers for suppliers who want to cut their emissions. GFI offers direct financial support and financing at favourable terms, made possible by our financial strength and network of banking partners.
The investments we support generally fall into one of these categories:
Energy efficiency projects to help suppliers reduce the total amount of electricity and steam they use in their operations.
Electrification of high-energy processes to enable suppliers to move away from high usage of fossil fuels, including heat pumps and thermal heat storage.
Installation of onsite solar panels so factories can generate their own renewable energy, reduce the risk of power cuts and save significantly on their energy bills.
Investment in offsite solar or wind facilities that benefit factories and local communities.
Replacing boilers or changing fuel type to replace fossil fuels with more efficient and renewable alternatives.
Power purchase agreements (PPAs)
We are signing PPAs with renewable energy developers. In these contracts we commit to a fixed price for electricity generated by solar parks or wind farms that have not yet been built. This removes the electricity price risk for the developer, makes the project viable and increases the amount of renewable energy available on the local grid. PPAs also help us to meet our goal of sourcing 100% renewable electricity for our stores, offices and distribution centres by 2030.
H&M Group Ventures
Our venture capital arm backs entrepreneurs who are set to transform the fashion industry and invests in companies across several themes including decarbonisation technology and circular solutions. Recent investments include Rondo and Syre.
Collaborative programmes
A single factory could make a sweatshirt for H&M, a pair of trousers for another brand and a hoodie for a third. When we invest in a factory like this, all three companies benefit from reduced emissions. But, if we joined forces and addressed the financial barriers together, we could act faster, increase the investment and have a much bigger impact.
Collaborative finance is key to driving the rapid, large-scale change we need in our industry. We are working with financial institutions and other fashion brands to develop and participate in different financing initiatives:
Future Supplier Initiative (FSI)
FSI brings together brands to collectively finance decarbonisation projects in shared suppliers producing fabric and finished garments. It keeps the cost of capital low for factories and includes access to technical support, as well as the opportunity to build long-term, resilient business relationships. H&M Group, Gap Inc., Mango and BESTSELLER are currently developing investment proposals for the first projects at shared suppliers in Bangladesh, targeting the most impactful activities at factory level. Next steps include implementing the projects and scaling to new regions when more brands join the initiative.
Fashion Climate Fund
We are one of the lead partners in Apparel Impact Institute’s Fashion Climate Fund, which funds impact programmes to pilot and scale new technologies in the textile, apparel and footwear supply chains.
Bangladesh wind farm
We have signed a letter of intent to co-invest in developing a wind farm in Bangladesh alongside BESTSELLER. The project is facilitated by Global Fashion Agenda and Copenhagen Infrastructure Partners.

By working together, we aim to lead the fashion industry to operating in ways that keep our planet safe.
Over ten years ago, H&M Group and WWF embarked on an ambitious collaboration to create a more sustainable fashion industry. The idea behind the partnership is to address the most pressing environmental impacts our entire value chain as well as taking global leadership to champion wider action across the global fashion business.
Water
Making fashion uses lots of freshwater and causes pollution. And with lots of different suppliers spread over a wide area, we need to find solutions that address these challenges on a local and global level. By bringing together companies, policy makers and communities we can drive change and share water resources in a more equitable and sustainable way.
Climate
Making fibres, processing materials, dyeing and garment manufacturing requires a lot of energy. As does the washing and drying of clothing once it’s been sold to our customers. With the impacts of the climate crisis already being felt, we need to reduce emissions from our value chain and beyond, as well as inspiring other companies and policy makers to do the same.
Biodiversity
From raw materials to garment use, the fashion industry impacts biodiversity on every level. Producing fibres like cotton and wool takes up vast areas of land, reducing space for nature. Conventional cotton farming uses pesticides and fertilisers and fabric processing pollutes river basins. We are committed to reducing our impact on nature, as well as protecting and restoring biodiversity.
To be successful we need to take a holistic view
Water, climate and biodiversity are important earth systems that work together to protect our planet and keep it healthy. Each one is dependent on the others. For example, biodiversity needs clean water to survive. However, the availability and quality of water is affected by the climate emergency. And to mitigate the climate emergency, we need diverse and robust biodiversity. That is why we take a holistic view and work on all three areas with WWF.
Water
We aim to have a positive impact on water, targeting solutions and working with stakeholders to address the different challenges we see across our value chain. We’ve been working with WWF on water since the start of our partnership. Some of our joint initiatives include:
Developing a holistic water strategy to reduce risks in our value chain, keep us operating within the freshwater use planetary boundary, embed water in our decision-making and prioritise working with stakeholders to create value for water.
Using WWF’s Risk filter to assess water risks in our supply chain, set locally relevant targets and take appropriate action.
We supported WWF to produce two reports to encourage the fashion industry to take a more holistic approach to water issues. Eau Courant discusses the impact of the apparel and textile industry on water, while Avant-Garde looks at the risks facing the industry.
Climate
At H&M Group, we have ambitious goals to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions and have been taking collective action on climate with WWF since 2016, including:
Developing H&M Group’s climate strategy to achieve net-zero through reducing emissions, renewable energy and climate resilience.
Launching a supplier programme in India to remove obstacles to investing in low carbon technology.
Joining WWF’s global climate leadership program, Climate Business Network, to encourage the fashion industry and other companies to take action on the climate crisis and learn from what others are doing.
Policy push to encourage European Institutions to vote for more renewable energy and better energy efficiency and a climate neutral EU by 2050.
Together with WWF, we have called on Members of the EU Parliament and the Council of the EU to adopt ambitious energy efficiency and renewable energy targets in the Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency Directives for 2030.
Holding training sessions for our suppliers and other textile companies to learn more about the Science Based Target Initiative.
Biodiversity
Our ambition is to contribute to the global goals for nature across our value chain. Biodiversity became a stand-alone theme in our partnership with WWF in 2021. Since then our biodiversity work has included:
Engaging government leaders through platforms like Business for Nature to call for policy frameworks to halt and reverse biodiversity loss by 2030.
Providing input to Science Based Targets Network‘s nature target setting method..
Supporting smallholder cotton farmers in India to adopt regenerative agriculture practices to improve soil health and biodiversity.
Developing an app that helps supplier factories in Cambodia verify that the wood used for steam production comes from approved sources.
Working with communal smallholders and large commercial sheep farmers in South Africa on regenerative wool production practices.
Supporting the development of the WWF Biodiversity Risk Filter – a tool to help companies understand their biodiversity impacts and dependencies.
For more details on selected projects, please see the biodiversity page.

Share buyback
At the annual general meeting 2024, a general authorisation was passed for the board to be able to buy back the company’s own B shares until the 2025 annual general meeting. If the board chooses to utilise this authority, amounts and other details will be communicated before repurchases are initiated.
Proposed authorisation to allow share buybacks
The board of directors will ask the 2025 annual general meeting for a general authorisation allowing the board to buy back the group’s own B shares in the period up to the 2026 annual general meeting. This general authorisation is, among other things, one of the tools for the board to use if surplus liquidity is identified.

Wages
Making sure garment workers are paid fairly is a big challenge. As one of the biggest fashion companies in the world, we have an important role in empowering workers and improving livelihoods to contribute to the socio-economic development of countries where we produce.
Driving change
A fair living wage is an income earned during normal working hours that meets the basic needs of workers and their families, with some left over for extra expenses or savings. 
Like most fashion companies, we don’t own any factories or make our own clothes – we outsource production to independent manufacturers. This means we don’t pay garment workers’ salaries, nor can we decide how much they are paid. 
But there are many things we can do to have a positive impact on wages and wage development to give workers and their families better livelihoods, improved working conditions and more power in the workplace. We’re taking responsibility and driving change by: 
Setting clear standards and expectations for every supplier that makes our products, as well as taking action if the standards are not met, which is clearly stated in our Sustainability Commitment.  
Ensuring that our purchasing practices – the way we place our orders and the prices we pay – enable the payment of correct wages. 
Helping suppliers implement effective wage management systems that classify jobs according to skill level and pay workers according to their competence.  
Providing education, services and frameworks that empower workers to negotiate their own wages and supporting suppliers to improve working conditions. 
Working with partners, peers, experts and governments to improve wages at both industry and country level. We are a founding member of ACT, an agreement between global brands and trade unions that aims to improve wages through collective bargaining, freedom of association and responsible purchasing practices. For example, in 2024 we signed an agreement supporting Collective Bargaining Agreements including wages in Cambodia, which was developed through close collaboration between employers, unions and brands.
How we work
Our production supply chain spans over many countries and contributes to the employment of over 1.4 million people. For many working in the garment and textile sector, especially women, this is their first formal employment and an opportunity to earn a regular income. 
We have a significant responsibility to uphold the rights of workers in our supply chain and ensure they know these rights, which include good working conditions, proper representation, improved wages and opportunities to develop. 
As far back as the 1970s we established production offices in the countries where our garments were made. This was, and still is, a key strategy and a valuable asset for engaging with workers, factories, governments, local trade unions and NGOs. 
By building and maintaining close relationships with factory owners we can support them to improve wage-management systems and develop well-functioning industrial relations. 
What we do
To drive fair and competitive wages in our supply chain, we take a global approach that feeds into country-specific strategies while considering national contexts and legal settings. This way our work is adapted to better meet the conditions in production countries and we can help our suppliers improve the wages of their workers.  
Our wage strategy
Having a well-established local presence in many of the countries where our clothes are made also means we can be hands-on in training workers about their rights, management about their responsibilities, and support the democratic election of worker representatives through trade unions or worker committees. 
The key components of our wage strategy are our programmes to set up wage-management systems in our suppliers’ factories, strengthening factory-level industrial relations and following responsible purchasing practices. We also address systemic issues including wage-setting mechanisms, such as collective bargaining and statutory minimum wage at country level, as well as social protection systems. We also focus on efficiency programmes that support productivity gains and improvements at factories.   
Within our own operations we focus on good purchasing practices, which in turn enable suppliers to pay the actual cost of labour.

Intervention level: Indicates the level at which H&M Group works. At a country level, we work with governments advocating for change. At a factory level, we work with management to change systems of structure.
Influence: Indicates how much influence we have. In some areas we have a lot of influence, for example in our purchasing practices. In others, our influence is less, such as social protection.
Impact: Indicates how each area impacts wages. It can either directly contribute to increasing wages or it can indirectly enable wage increases.
Industrial relations: Open dialogue between workers and managers is essential for fair jobs. Employees who have a voice and can influence their workplace are far more likely to enjoy good working conditions. 
In 2020, we engaged with experts to identify what drove wage increases between 2013 and 2019. We also involved stakeholders and industry researchers to develop the best mix of interventions, adding new areas where we aim to use our influence. Based on this input and evidence, we refocused our work to become more effective by: 
Adopting a more localised, market-based approach based on data so we can do what works best in each production country. 
Integrating social protection as part of statutory minimum-wage advocacy. 
Extending our external engagement to create industry-wide awareness and action, including collaboration beyond our sector. 
Informing and educating suppliers about our commitment to improving wage systems. 
Helping our suppliers improve productivity so they can pay higher wages and remain competitive. 
Ensuring internal cooperation, with business and public affairs teams working together for systemic changes. 
Promoting fair wages
Fair wages go beyond the statutory minimum wage set by governments. They contribute to economic and social development for both workers and employers. Setting a fair wage takes an individual worker’s skills, experience, performance, and responsibility into consideration and means: 
Workers work reasonable hours and are fairly paid for these hours, so they can meet the needs of their families and live good lives. 
Workers have the knowledge, freedom, and power to negotiate wages and working conditions. 
Employers have the knowledge, frameworks and support to operate and grow sustainably so they can provide stable, productive, and fair workplaces. 
To improve wages for all garment workers, several factors need to be considered, including statutory minimum wage, social protection, collective bargaining, bonuses, skill and performance recognition, benefits and productivity developments. Since 2012, we have been monitoring wages paid to employees by all our direct suppliers* and we work continuously to improve our data collection processes. Each quarter we collect and check monthly data.  
It is uncommon in the fashion industry to have access to such detailed wage data.  This is a result of the trust we have built up with our suppliers over the years.

Why do we monitor wages?
We want to make sure suppliers are paying at least the statutory minimum wage and that all benefits and additional allowances due to workers are paid correctly, on time, and in full. For this reason, wages data are checked through virtual and in-person audits by our local teams.
We need data we can rely on so we can understand how wages are progressing. Understanding why wages have increased over time gives us important insight into how we should intervene. Such data also allows us to get crucial input from external experts. 
To enable us to itemise the labour costs and ensure that the price we pay our suppliers allows them to pay wages correctly. This is part of our commitment to responsible purchasing practices. 
We review suppliers based on their performance in social sustainability. Those who show strong and responsible practices can access better business opportunities with us, including longer-term planning and more insight into upcoming product needs.
We want to lead the industry towards a higher level of transparency. 
We want to show our customers and other stakeholders reliable data and be transparent about our supply chain.
Real changes in wage data may be obscured by fluctuating exchange rates. Therefore, from 2023, we are publishing wage data both converted to USD and in the local currency in which they are paid. This increases accuracy and enables greater comparison of wages across markets.
*By direct suppliers we mean suppliers we have contractual relationships with. They are also called tier 1 suppliers and are the ones who sew our clothing. They, in turn, have their own suppliers, for example companies who make the fabric they use. 
How we learn
We evaluate and assess our strategy and activities regularly to make sure we’re doing the right things and having a positive impact. Additionally, we continuously collaborate with external experts and researchers to identify what works well and what we should do better. 
For example, in 2020, three external wage experts — Greg Distelhorst and Jee-Eun Shin from the University of Toronto and Raymond Robertson from Texas A&M University — evaluated our previous strategy results and found that:  
The focus areas of our wage work (statutory minimum wages, factory wage systems, purchasing practices, workplace dialogue and collective bargaining agreements) reinforce each other and are all essential to achieve wage increases. 
Suppliers enrolled in factory-level wage management systems and workplace dialogue programmes increased real-wages by an average of 2.8% more than suppliers not enrolled in these programmes. When these programmes are accompanied by a wage grid, which classifies jobs according to skill level, the total increase in real wages was on average 5% higher than suppliers not enrolled in these programmes. 
H&M Group has the most influence through wage management systems, but for maximum impact, work is also needed on statutory minimum wages and social protection on a national level, and productivity on a factory level. 
Presence of trade unions in factories positively affected wages by an average of 5.5%. 
Increasing efficiency by ten percentage points has proven to increase wages on average by 4.6%, strengthening our view that productivity is an enabler for higher wages. 
Instead of tracking progress based on factory enrolment in workplace dialogue and wage programmes, we’re measuring the real effect on wages, and we’ve updated our internal key performance indicators accordingly. We’ll continue to review these as we develop our strategy.
Why the price tag doesn’t reflect the payslip
It’s easy to assume that the price you see on the tag always reflects the effort put into making a garment, but that’s not usually the case.
A single factory often produces clothing for several brands, and workers are paid the same amount to make a €200 garment as they are paid to make a €20 garment. That’s why increased prices in stores don’t necessarily lead to increased wages for factory workers.
H&M Group can offer sustainable fashion at affordable prices because we are a large company with a long history – we buy large volumes, have efficient logistics, our own designers, our own stores, strong market knowledge, long-term relationships with our suppliers, and no middlemen. Wages are just one of many factors when it comes to pricing products.
Even though we don’t pay textile workers ourselves, there are many things we can do to influence wage development, including developing our purchasing practices, educating workers on their rights, and helping suppliers implement fair wage management systems. (see our wage strategy). We can also use our size and influence to drive change within our industry and encourage other brands to be responsible purchasers.

Collective bargaining brings lasting change
One of the best ways to achieve substantial and long-lasting wage increases for all workers is through fair negotiations between empowered workers, trade unions and employers. This requires industry-wide collective bargaining agreements. These contracts between unions and employers set terms and conditions of employment such as working hours and wages. 
Our strategy for improving wages in the supply chain places a strong focus on establishing well-functioning dialogue and democratically elected worker representation in factories. This gives workers better opportunities to make their voices heard and resolve any issues.  And it is an essential precondition for collective bargaining agreements. 
Democratically elected worker representation also helps prepare suppliers for maturing industrial relations, including trade unions and industry-wide collective bargaining agreements. Many of our supplier factories undergo a mindset shift when they initiate this kind of change, recognising the benefits of improved dialogue with their workers and worker representatives. In turn, this leads to an increase in the number of supplier factories with one or more trade unions. While this is a positive development that we will continue to support, more needs to be done by everyone involved. 
All companies can make a difference by ensuring their purchasing practices allow the payment of agreed-upon wages and enable collective bargaining. Brands also need to advocate for governments to set the legal frameworks that ensure the right to freedom of association and enabling collective bargaining. 
This is not an easy thing to achieve, especially considering trade union representation is low in many sourcing markets and industrial relation systems are often immature or even legally restricted. However, we believe this is the best way wages can increase in a sustainable way. 
Social protection
Social protection helps workers by offering a safety net, financial stability and support for their well-being. We track access to social protection in our supplier factories. When needed, we work with business partners to raise awareness among workers about their rights to social insurance and benefits such as unemployment, pensions, maternity leave, healthcare and injury compensation.
In 2022, in Bangladesh, we joined the ILO, the German development agency GIZ and six other brands to launch a pilot for an employment injury scheme. Backed by 68 brands, the scheme aims to ensure workers in the export-oriented ready-made garment sector are eligible for compensation for workplace injuries or disabilities, in line with international standards (ILO C.121). The Government plans to make it a permanent national programme by 2026. It will cover around 4 million garment workers.
