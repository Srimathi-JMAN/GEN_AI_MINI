About Spotify
Since its launch in 2008, Spotify has revolutionised music listening. Our move into podcasting brought innovation and a new generation of listeners to the medium. In 2022, we took the next leap, entering the fast-growing audiobook market—continuing to shape the future of audio. Today, more listeners than ever can discover, manage and enjoy over 100 million tracks, 6.5 million podcast titles, and 350,000 audiobooks a la carte on Spotify. We are the world’s most popular audio streaming subscription service with more than 675 million users, including 263 million subscribers in more than 180 markets.

Building the World’s #1 Audio Network
Spotify transformed music listening forever when we launched in 2008, moving the music industry from a "transaction-based" experience of buying and owning audio content to an "access-based" model allowing users to stream on demand.

Spotify Cookie Policy
Effective as of 29 May 2023
What are cookies?
How do we use cookies?
Options for managing cookies and interest-based ads
Updates to this Policy
How to contact us
This policy describes how Spotify uses cookies. From now on, we'll call it the 'Policy'. The purpose of this Policy is to provide you, a user of Spotify's services and/or websites (we'll collectively call these the 'Services'), with clear information about the purposes for which Spotify uses cookies and the choices you have when it comes to managing your cookie settings.
1. What are cookies?
Cookies are small pieces of text which are downloaded to your device, for example, when you visit a website. Cookies are useful because they allow Spotify and our partners to uniquely recognise your device and support the continuity of your experience, for example by helping us to understand your preferences or past actions. You can find more general information about cookies at: www.allaboutcookies.org.
2. How do we use cookies?
Cookies do lots of different jobs, like letting you navigate between pages efficiently, remembering your preferences, and generally improving your user experience. They can also help to ensure that ads you see online are more relevant to you and your interests.
Spotify uses two main categories of cookie: (1) strictly necessary cookies; and (2) optional cookies:
1. Strictly Necessary Cookies
These cookies are set by Spotify or a third party on our behalf, and are essential to enable you to use the features of our Services, such as technically delivering content, setting your privacy preferences, logging in, making payments or filling in forms. Without these cookies, our Services cannot be provided so you cannot decline them.
2. Optional Cookies
Optional cookies may be 'first party cookies' or 'third party cookies'. First party cookies set directly by Spotify or by a third party at our request. Third party cookies are set directly by a third party or set by Spotify at the request of a third party, such as our analytics or advertising service providers. You can see a list of these partners at this link. Spotify, or our partners, use optional cookies in the following ways:
Cookie Type
Purpose
Strictly Necessary Cookies
These cookies are essential in order to enable you to use the features of our Services, such as technically delivering content, setting your privacy preferences, logging in, making payments or filling in forms. Without these cookies, our Services cannot be provided so you cannot decline them.
Performance Cookies
These cookies collect information about how visitors use our Services. For example, these cookies allow us to count visits to our website and to understand how visitors found the website.
Web analytics that use cookies to gather data to enhance the performance of a website fall into this category. For example, they may be used for testing designs and ensuring a consistent look and feel is maintained for the user. We may also obtain information from our email newsletters or other communications we send to you, including whether you opened or forwarded a newsletter or clicked on any of its content. This information tells us about our newsletters' effectiveness and helps us ensure that we're delivering information that you find interesting.
This category does not include cookies used for behavioural/interest-based targeted advertising networks.
Functional
These cookies allow our Services to remember choices you make such as your user name, language or the region you are in and provide enhanced, more personal features and content. For example, these cookies can be used to remember changes you have made to parts of web pages that you can customise.
These cookies remember choices you make to improve your experience. If you do not allow these cookies then some of the choices you have made on previous visits to our Services will not be saved.
Targeting or advertising Cookies
These cookies collect information about your browsing habits in order to deliver advertisements more relevant to you and to understand your interests. They are also used to limit the number of times you see an advertisement as well as help measure the effectiveness of the advertisements Spotify shares. These cookies log that you have visited a website and this information may be shared with other organisations such as advertisers. Additionally, Spotify may share limited data with other platforms to market Spotify promotions, features, or new releases on those other platforms. If you do not allow these cookies you will still experience advertising but it will be less tailored to you.
3. Options for managing cookies and interest-based ads
Web Browser Settings
You can use your web browser settings to accept, refuse and delete cookies. To do this, follow the instructions provided by your browser (usually located within the 'Help', 'Tools' or 'Edit' settings).
Please note that if you set your browser to refuse cookies, you may not be able to use all the features of the Spotify website. To find out more information, you can visit www.allaboutcookies.org.
Mobile Identifiers
On your mobile device, your operating system may provide you with additional options to opt out of interest based advertising or to otherwise reset your mobile identifiers. For example, you may use the 'Allow Apps to Request to Track' setting (on iOS devices) or the 'Opt out of Interest-Based Ads' setting (on Android devices). These settings allow you to limit the use of information about your use of apps for purposes of serving ads tailored to your interests.
Interest-Based Advertising
You may opt-out of receiving interest-based advertisements by turning off the 'Tailored ads' toggle, located in the Privacy Settings page of your Spotify Account. If you opt-out of receiving interest-based ads using the Tailored ads toggle, Spotify will not share your information with third party advertising partners or use information received by them to show you interest-based ads. You may still receive ads when using the Services based on your Spotify registration information and your real-time usage of Spotify, but the ads may be less relevant to you.
Certain tailored advertisements that we, or a service provider acting on our behalf, display to you may include the 'Ad Choices' icon or another mechanism to opt out of receiving interest-based advertisements. You may click on the AdChoices icon or visit www.aboutads.info to:
learn more about the collection and use of information about your online activities for interest based advertising; or
opt out of having your data used for interest based advertising by Digital Advertising Alliance (DAA) participating companies.
4. Updates to this Policy
We may occasionally make changes to this Policy.
When we make material changes to this Policy, we'll provide you with prominent notice as appropriate under the circumstances. For example, we may display a prominent notice within the Spotify Services or send you an email or device notification.
5. How to contact us
Thank you for reading this Policy. If you have any questions about this Cookie Policy, please contact our Data Protection Officer by using the Customer Support contact form details on the Privacy Center or by writing to us at the following address:

Spotify Privacy Policy
Effective as of 10 October 2024
1. About this Policy
2. Your personal data rights and controls
3. Personal data we collect about you
4. Our purpose for using your personal data
5. Sharing your personal data
6. Data retention
7. Transfer to other countries
8. Keeping your personal data safe
9. Children
10. Changes to this Policy
11. How to contact us
1. About this Policy
This Privacy Policy describes how we process your personal data at Spotify AB. From now on, we'll call it the 'Policy'.
It applies to your use of:
all Spotify streaming services as a user. For example this includes:
your use of Spotify on any device
the personalisation of your user experience. Watch our personalisation explainer video to learn more about this
the infrastructure required to provide our services
connection of your Spotify account with another application
both our free or paid streaming options (each a 'Service Option')
other Spotify services which include a link to this Policy. These include Spotify websites, Customer Service and the Community Site
From now on, we'll collectively call these the 'Spotify Service'.
From time to time, we may develop new or offer additional services. They'll also be subject to this Policy, unless stated otherwise when we introduce them.
This Policy is not...
the Spotify Terms of Use, which is a separate document. The Terms of Use outline the legal contract between you and Spotify for using the Spotify Service. It also describes the rules of Spotify and your user rights
about your use of other Spotify services which have their own privacy policy. Other Spotify services include Anchor, Soundtrap, Megaphone and the Spotify Live app
Other resources and settings
Key information about your personal data is right here in this Policy. However, you might want to take a look at our other privacy resources and controls:
Privacy Center: A user-friendly hub with summaries of key topics and helpful videos. It includes the 'Your Privacy Controls' video which shows you how to exercise your user rights and make choices about the way we process your data. See Section 2 'Your personal data rights and controls' for more on user rights.
Account Privacy: Control the processing of certain personal data, including tailored advertising.
Notification Settings: Set which marketing communications you get from Spotify.
Settings (found in the Desktop and Mobile versions of Spotify): Control certain aspects of the Spotify Service such as 'Social' or 'Explicit Content'. On the 'Social' setting, you can:
start a Private session
choose whether to share what you listen to on Spotify with your followers
choose whether to show your recently played artists on your public profile
On the 'Explicit Content' setting you can control whether explicit-rated content can be played on your Spotify account.
Cookies Policy: Information on how we use cookies and how to manage your cookie preferences. Cookies are files saved on your phone, tablet or computer when you visit a website.
2. Your personal data rights and controls
Many privacy laws give rights to individuals over their personal data. These laws include the General Data Protection Regulation, or 'GDPR'.
Some rights only apply when Spotify uses a certain 'legal basis' to process your data. We explain each legal basis, and when Spotify uses each one, in Section 4 'Our purpose for using your personal data'.
The table below explains:
your rights
circumstances when they apply (such as the legal basis required)
how to use them
You can also watch our video about Your Privacy Controls.
It’s your right to...
How?
Be informed
Be informed of the personal data we process about you and how we process it.
We inform you:

through this Policy
through information provided to you as you use the Spotify Service
by answering your specific questions and requests when you contact us
Access
Request access to the personal data we process about you.

To request a copy of your personal data from Spotify, either:

use the “Download your data” tool on your Account Privacy page, or
contact us

When you download your data you will receive the information about your data that Spotify has to provide under Article 15 of the GDPR. If you would like more information about how we process your personal data, you can contact us.
Rectification
Request that we amend or update your personal data where it’s inaccurate or incomplete.
You can edit your User Data under ‘Edit profile’ in your account or by contacting us.
Erasure
Request that we erase certain of your personal data.

For example, you can ask us to erase personal data:

that we no longer need for the purpose it was collected for
that we process based on the legal basis of consent, and you withdraw your consent
when you object (see section ‘Object’ below) and
you make a justified objection, or
you object to direct marketing

There are situations where Spotify is unable to delete your data, for example when:

it’s still necessary to process the data for the purpose we collected it for
Spotify’s interest in using the data overrides your interest in having it deleted. For example, where we need the data to protect our services from fraud
Spotify has a legal obligation to keep the data, or
Spotify needs the data to establish, exercise or defend legal claims. For example, if there’s an unresolved issue relating to your account
There are several ways you can erase personal data from Spotify:

to remove audio content from your profile select the relevant content and choose to remove it. For example, you can remove playlists from your profile, or remove a track from your playlist
to request erasure of your other personal data from Spotify, follow the steps on our support page. This data includes your User Data, Usage Data and other data listed in Section 3 ‘Personal data we collect about you’
you can also contact us to request erasure
Restriction
Request that we stop processing all or some of your personal data.

You can do this if:

your personal data is inaccurate
our processing is unlawful
we do not need your information for a specific purpose, or
you object to our processing and we are assessing your objection request. See section ‘Object’ below

You can request that we stop this processing temporarily or permanently.
You can exercise your right to restriction by contacting us.
Object
Object to us processing your personal data.

You can do this if:

Spotify is processing your personal data on the legal basis of legitimate interests, or
Spotify is processing your personal data for tailored advertising
To exercise your right to object, you can:

use controls on the Spotify Service to switch off or adjust some features which process your personal data. See the end of this section on how you can control tailored advertising
contact us
Data portability
Request a copy of your personal data in electronic format and the right to transmit that personal data for use in another party’s service.

You can request us to transmit your data when we are processing your personal data on the legal bases of consent or performance of contract. However Spotify will try to honour any request to the extent possible.
For information about how to exercise the right to portability, see ‘Access’ above.
Not be subject to automated decision making
Not be subject to a decision based solely on automated decision making (decisions without human involvement), including profiling, where the decision would have a legal effect on you or produce a similarly significant effect.
Spotify does not carry out this type of automated decision making in the Spotify Service.
Withdrawal of consent
Withdraw your consent to us collecting or using your personal data.

You can do this if Spotify is processing your personal data on the legal basis of consent.
To withdraw your consent, you can:

adjust the relevant control on Spotify
contact us
Right to lodge a complaint
Contact the Swedish Authority for Privacy Protection or your local data protection authority about any questions or concerns.
You can find the Swedish Authority’s details here. You can also go to the website of your local data protection authority.
Tailored advertising controls
What is tailored advertising?
This is when we use information about you to tailor ads to be more relevant to you. This is also known as interest based advertising.
An example of tailored advertising is when an advertising partner has information suggesting you like cars. This could enable us to show you ads about cars.
How to control tailored advertising:
You can control tailored advertising on your Account Privacy page under 'Tailored Ads'.
You can also control tailored advertising for some podcasts using the link in the episode's show description. This applies where the content provider inserts advertising into the podcast to fund it. The hosting provider, which might not be Spotify, manages these controls for the podcast.
If you are 'opted out' of Tailored Ads on your Account Privacy page, you may still get advertising. This can include on our free Service Option, as well as our paid Service Option, as applicable (for example, advertising in podcasts). This type of advertising is based on your registration information and what you are currently listening to on our services. For example, if you are listening to a cooking podcast, you may hear an ad for a food processor.
3. Personal data we collect about you
These tables set out the categories of personal data we collect from you. You can also watch our video about Personal Data at Spotify.

6. Data retention
We keep your personal data only as long as necessary to provide you with the Spotify Service and for Spotify's legitimate and essential business purposes, such as:
maintaining the performance of the Spotify Service
making data-driven business decisions about new features and offerings
complying with our legal obligations
resolving disputes
Here are some of the categories of our retention periods, and the criteria we use to determine them:
Data retained until you remove it
It's your right to request that we delete certain of your personal data. See the section on 'Erasure' in Section 2 'Your personal data rights and controls' for more information, and the circumstances in which we can act on your request.
You can also delete certain personal data directly from the Spotify Service: for example, you can edit or delete your profile picture. Where users are able to see and update the personal data themselves, we keep the information for as long as the user chooses unless one of the limited purposes described below applies.
Data that expires after a specific period of time
We have set certain retention periods so that some data expires after a specific period of time. For example, personal data you may input as part of search queries is generally deleted after 90 days.
Data retained until your Spotify account is deleted
We keep some data until your Spotify account is deleted. Examples of this include your Spotify username and profile information. We also typically keep streaming history for the life of an account, for example, to provide retrospective playlists that users enjoy and personalised recommendations that take listening habits into account (for example, Your Time Capsule or Your Summer Rewind). When your Spotify account is deleted, this category of your data is deleted or de-identified.
Data retained for extended time periods for limited purposes
After your account is deleted, we keep some data for a longer time period but for very limited purposes. For example, we may be subject to legal or contractual obligations that require this. These may include mandatory data retention laws, government orders to preserve data relevant to an investigation, or data kept for the purposes of litigation. We may also keep data that has been removed from the Spotify Service for a limited period of time. This could be:
to help ensure user safety, or
to protect against harmful content on our platform.
This helps us investigate potential breaches of our User Guidelines and Platform Rules. On the other hand, we will remove unlawful content if the law requires us to do so.
7. Transfer to other countries
Because of the global nature of our business, your personal data will be shared internationally among Spotify group companies, subcontractors and partners when carrying out the activities described in this Policy. They may process your data in countries whose data protection laws are not considered to be as strong as EU laws or the laws which apply where you live. For example, they may not give you the same rights over your data.
Whenever we transfer personal data internationally, we use tools to:
make sure the data transfer complies with applicable law
help to give your data the same level of protection as it has in the EU
To ensure each data transfer complies with applicable EU legislation, we use the following legal mechanisms:
Standard Contractual Clauses ('SCCs'). These clauses require the other party to protect your data and to provide you with EU-level rights and protections. For example, we use SCCs to transfer the personal data described in Section 3 'Personal data we collect about you' to our hosting provider which uses servers in the US. You can exercise your rights under the Standard Contractual Clauses by contacting us or the third party who processes your personal data.
Adequacy Decisions. This means that we transfer personal data to countries outside of the European Economic Area which have adequate laws to protect personal data, as determined by the European Commission. For example, we transfer the personal data described in Section 3 'Personal data we collect about you' to vendors based in the United Kingdom, Canada, Japan, Republic of Korea and Switzerland.
We also identify and use additional protections as appropriate for each data transfer. For example, we use:
technical protections, such as encryption and pseudonymisation
policies and processes to challenge disproportionate or unlawful government authority requests
8. Keeping your personal data safe
We're committed to protecting our users' personal data. We put in place appropriate technical and organisational measures to help protect the security of your personal data. However, be aware that no system is ever completely secure.
We have put various safeguards in place including pseudonymisation, encryption such as Transport Layer Security (TLS) and AES, access, and retention policies to guard against unauthorised access and unnecessary retention of personal data in our systems. In addition, personal data stored in our computer systems are secured by physical security measures.
To protect your user account, we encourage you to:
use a strong password which you only use for your Spotify account
never share your password with anyone
limit access to your computer and browser
log out once you have finished using the Spotify Service on a shared device
read more detail on protecting your account
You can log out of Spotify in multiple places at once by using the 'Sign out everywhere' function on your account page.
If other individuals have access to your Spotify account, then they can access personal data, controls and the Spotify Service available in your account. For example, you might have allowed someone to use your account on a shared device.
It's your responsibility to only allow individuals to use your account where you're comfortable sharing this personal data with them. Anyone else's use of your Spotify account may impact your personalised recommendations and be included in your data download.
9. Children
Note: This Policy doesn't apply to Spotify Kids unless the Spotify Kids Privacy Policy says so. Spotify Kids is a separate Spotify application.
The Spotify Service has a minimum 'Age Limit' in each country or region. The Spotify Service is not directed to children whose age:
is under the age of 13 years
makes it illegal to process their personal data, or
requires parental consent to process their personal data
We do not knowingly collect or use personal data from children under the applicable Age Limit. If you're under the Age Limit, do not use the Spotify Service, and do not provide any personal data to us. Instead, we recommend using a Spotify Kids account.
If you're a parent of a child under the Age Limit and become aware that your child has provided personal data to Spotify, contact us.
If we learn that we've collected the personal data of a child under the applicable Age Limit, we'll take reasonable steps to delete the personal data. This may require us to delete the Spotify account for that child.
When using a shared device on the main Spotify Service, be cautious about playing or recommending any inappropriate content to individuals under 18 years old.
10. Changes to this Policy
We may occasionally make changes to this Policy.
When we make material changes to this Policy, we'll provide you with prominent notice as appropriate under the circumstances. For example, we may display a prominent notice within the Spotify Service or send you an email or device notification.
11. How to contact us
For any questions or concerns about this Policy, contact our Grievance Officer/Data Protection Officer any one of these ways:
email privacy@spotify.com
write to us at: Spotify, Regeringsgatan 19, 111 53 Stockholm, Sweden
For the purposes of the GDPR, Spotify AB is the data controller of personal data processed under this Policy.

Warranty disclaimers
Spotify will provide the Spotify Service using reasonable care and skill and in accordance with any specification of the Spotify Service provided by Spotify, however, subject to that, the Spotify Service is provided "as is" and "as available," without any warranties of any kind, whether express, implied, or statutory. Further, Spotify and all owners of the content disclaim any express, implied, and statutory warranties regarding the content, including warranties of satisfactory quality, merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, or non-infringement. Neither Spotify nor any owner of content warrants that the Spotify Service or content is free of malware or other harmful components. In addition, Spotify makes no representation regarding, nor does it warrant or assume any responsibility for, any third-party applications (or the content thereof), user content, devices or any product or service advertised, promoted or offered by a third party on or through the Spotify Service or any hyperlinked website, and Spotify is not responsible for any transactions between you and any third-party providers of the foregoing. No advice or information whether oral or in writing obtained by you from Spotify shall create any warranty on behalf of Spotify. While accessing the Spotify Service, you may have access to explicit content filtering features, but use of these features may still result in some explicit content being served and you should not rely on such features to filter all explicit content. Content may be directly updated/uploaded on the Spotify Service by a third party and therefore we make no warranty that you will not come across content that might not suit your sensibilities and might be considered inappropriate by you. In such a scenario, you are free to discontinue or opt not to view/stream/consume such content. This section applies to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law.
Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of implied warranties or limitations on applicable statutory rights of a consumer, so the exclusion and limitations in this section may not apply to you and nothing will affect your statutory rights.
Limitation of Liability and Time for Filing a Claim
Subject to applicable law, you agree that your sole and exclusive remedy for any problems or dissatisfaction with the Spotify Service is to uninstall any Spotify software and to stop accessing the Spotify Service. You agree that Spotify has no obligation or liability arising from or related to third-party applications or the content thereof made available through or in connection with the Spotify Service, and while your relationship with such third-party applications may be governed by separate agreements with such third parties, your sole and exclusive remedy, as with respect to Spotify, for any problems or dissatisfaction with any third-party applications or the content thereof, is to uninstall or stop using such third-party applications.
**In no event will Spotify, its officers, shareholders, employees, agents, directors, subsidiaries, affiliates, successors, assigns, suppliers, or licensors be liable for (1) any indirect, special, incidental, punitive, exemplary, or consequential damages; (2) any loss of use, data, business, or profits (whether direct or indirect), in all cases arising out of the use of or inability to access the Spotify Service, devices, third-party applications, or third-party application content; or (3) aggregate liability for all claims relating to the Spotify Service, third-party applications, or third-party application content more than the greater of (a) the amounts paid by you to Spotify during the twelve months prior to the first claim; or (b) $30.00. Any liability we do have for losses you suffer is strictly limited to losses that were reasonably foreseeable. **
For clarification, these terms do not limit Spotify's liability for fraud, fraudulent misrepresentation, death or personal injury to the extent that applicable law would prohibit such a limitation and for any other liability that, by applicable law, may not be limited or excluded.
**Except where such restriction is prohibited under applicable law, any claim arising under these terms must be commenced (by filing a demand for arbitration or filing an individual action under the arbitration agreement below) within one (1) year after the date the party asserting the claim first knows or reasonably should know of the act, omission, or default giving rise to the claim; and there shall be no right to any remedy for any claim not asserted within that time period. **
Third Party Rights
You acknowledge and agree that the owners of the Content and certain distributors (such as app store providers) are intended beneficiaries of these Terms and have the right to enforce these Terms directly against you. Other than as set out in this section, these Terms are not intended to grant rights to anyone except you and Spotify, and in no event shall these Terms create any third-party beneficiary rights.
If you have downloaded any of our mobile software applications (each, an "App") from the Apple Inc. ("Apple") App Store or if you are using the App on an iOS device, you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agree to the following notice regarding Apple. These Terms are between you and Spotify only, not with Apple, and Apple is not responsible for the Spotify Service and the content thereof. Apple has no obligation whatsoever to furnish any maintenance and support services with respect to the Spotify Service. In the event of any failure of the Spotify Service to conform to any applicable warranty, you may notify Apple and Apple will refund the applicable purchase price for the App to you; and, to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, Apple has no other warranty obligation whatsoever with respect to the Spotify Service.

Apple is not responsible for the investigation, defense, settlement, and discharge of any third-party claim that the Spotify Service or your possession and use of the App infringe that third party's intellectual property rights. You agree to comply with any applicable third-party terms, when accessing the Spotify Service. Apple, and Apple's subsidiaries, are third-party beneficiaries of these Terms, and upon your acceptance of these Terms, Apple will have the right (and will be deemed to have accepted the right) to enforce these Terms against you as a third-party beneficiary of these Terms.

6.2 CLASS ACTION WAIVER
WHERE PERMITTED UNDER THE APPLICABLE LAW, YOU AND SPOTIFY AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION. Unless both you and Spotify agree, no arbitrator or judge may consolidate more than one person's claims or otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding.
6.3 ARBITRATION
If you are located in, are based in, have offices in, or do business in a jurisdiction in which this Section 6.3. is enforceable, the following mandatory arbitration provisions apply to you:
6.3.1 Dispute resolution and arbitration
You and Spotify agree that any dispute, claim, or controversy between you and Spotify arising in connection with or relating in any way to these Agreements or to your relationship with Spotify as a user of the Service (whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation, or any other legal theory, and whether the claims arise during or after the termination of the Agreements) will be determined by mandatory binding individual arbitration. Arbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court. THERE IS NO JUDGE OR JURY IN ARBITRATION, AND COURT REVIEW OF AN ARBITRATION AWARD IS LIMITED. There may be more limited discovery than in court. The arbitrator must follow this agreement and can award the same damages and relief as a court (including attorney fees), except that the arbitrator may not award declaratory or injunctive relief benefiting anyone but the parties to the arbitration. This arbitration provision will survive termination of the Agreements.
6.3.2 Exceptions
Notwithstanding clause 6.3.1 above, you and Spotify both agree that nothing herein will be deemed to waive, preclude, or otherwise limit either of our rights, at any time, to (1) bring an individual action in a small claims court ,(2) pursue enforcement actions through applicable federal, state, or local agencies where such actions are available, (3) seek injunctive relief in a court of law, or (4) to file suit in a court of law to address intellectual property infringement claims.
6.3.3 Arbitration rules
Either you or we may start arbitration proceedings. Any arbitration between you and Spotify will be finally settled under the Rules of Arbitration of the International Chamber of Commerce (the "ICC") then in force (the "ICC Rules") by one or more arbitrators appointed in accordance with the ICC Rules, as modified by these Agreements, and will be administered by the International Court of Arbitration of the ICC.
Any arbitration will be conducted in the English language and unless otherwise required by a mandatory law of a member state of the European Union or any other jurisdiction, the law to be applied in any arbitration shall be the law of [the relevant state or country described in clause 6.1], without regard to choice or conflicts of law principles.
6.3.4 Time for filing
Any arbitration must be commenced by filing a demand for arbitration within ONE (1) YEAR after the date the party asserting the claim first knows or reasonably should know of the act, omission, or default giving rise to the claim; and there shall be no right to any remedy for any claim not asserted within that time period. If applicable law prohibits a one-year limitation period for asserting claims, any claim must be asserted within the shortest time period permitted by applicable law.
6.3.5 Notice; Process
A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send a written notice of the dispute to the other, by certified mail or Federal Express (signature required), or in the event that we do not have a physical address on file for you, by electronic mail ("Notice"). Spotify's address for Notice is: [Spotify, Attn: General Counsel, 4 World Trade Center, 150 Greenwich Street, 62nd Floor, New York, New York 10007, USA]. The Notice must (1) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute; and (2) set forth the specific relief sought ("Demand"). We agree to use good faith efforts to resolve the claim directly, but if we do not reach an agreement to do so within 30 days after the Notice is received, you or Spotify may commence an arbitration proceeding. During the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by you or Spotify shall not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator makes a final decision and award, if any. In the event our dispute is finally resolved through arbitration in your favor, Spotify shall pay you (1) the amount awarded by the arbitrator, if any, (2) the last written settlement amount offered by Spotify in settlement of the dispute prior to the arbitrator's award; or (3) $1,000.00, whichever is greater. All documents and information disclosed in the course of the arbitration shall be kept strictly confidential by the recipient and shall not be used by the recipient for any purpose other than for purposes of the arbitration or the enforcement of the arbitrator's decision and award and shall not be disclosed except in confidence to persons who have a need to know for such purposes or as required by applicable law.Except as required to enforce the arbitrator's decision and award, neither you nor Spotify shall make any public announcement or public comment or originate any publicity concerning the arbitration, including, but not limited to, the fact that the parties are in dispute, the existence of the arbitration, or any decision or award of the arbitrator.
6.3.6 Modifications
In the event that Spotify makes any future change to this arbitration provision (other than a change to Spotify's address for Notice), you may reject any such change by sending us written notice within 30 days of the change to Spotify's address for Notice, in which case your account with Spotify shall be immediately terminated and this arbitration provision, as in effect immediately prior to the amendments you reject, shall survive.
6.3.7 Enforceability
If the class action waiver at Section 6.2 is found to be unenforceable in arbitration or if any part of this Section 6.3 is found to be invalid or unenforceable, then the entirety of this Section 6.3 shall be null and void and, in such case, the parties agree that the exclusive jurisdiction and venue described in Section 6.1 shall govern any action arising out of or related to the Agreements and you shall not be prevented from bringing proceedings at any time.
7. About these Terms
Under applicable law, you may have certain rights that can't be limited by a contract. These terms are in no way intended to restrict those rights.
Changes
We may make changes to these Terms (including any additional Spotify terms and conditions incorporated by reference herein) from time to time by notifying you of such changes by any reasonable means (before they take effect), including by posting a revised Agreement on the applicable Spotify Service (provided that, for material changes, we will seek to supplement such notice by email, an in-service pop-up message, or other means). Any such changes will not apply to any dispute between you and us arising prior to the date on which we posted the revised Terms, or other Spotify terms and conditions, incorporating such changes, or otherwise notified you of such changes. Your access of the Spotify Service following any changes to these Terms will constitute your acceptance of such changes. If you do not wish to continue accessing the Spotify Service under the updated Terms, you may terminate your account by contacting us. The effective date set forth at the top of this document indicates when these Terms were last changed.
Entire Agreement
Other than as stated in this section or as explicitly agreed upon in writing between you and Spotify, these Terms constitute all the terms and conditions agreed upon between you and Spotify and supersede any prior agreements in relation to the subject matter of these Terms, whether written or oral. As noted above, other terms and conditions governing access of the Spotify Service are incorporated herein by reference, including the following terms and conditions: the Spotify Premium Promotional Offer Terms; Spotify's Card Terms; the Spotify User Guidelines; the Spotify Copyright Policy; and the Spotify Support Community Terms.
Severability and Waiver
Unless as otherwise stated in these Terms, should any provision of these Terms be held invalid or unenforceable for any reason or to any extent, the remaining provisions of these Terms will not be affected, and the application of that provision shall be enforced to the extent permitted by law.
Any failure by Spotify or any third-party beneficiary to enforce these Terms or any provision thereof shall not waive Spotify's or the applicable third-party beneficiary's right to do so.
Assignment
Spotify may assign any or all of these Terms, and may assign or delegate, in whole or in part, any of its rights or obligations under these Terms. You may not assign these Terms, in whole or in part, nor transfer or sub-license your rights under these Terms, to any third party.

2. Your personal data rights and controls
3. Personal data we collect about you
4. Our purpose for using your personal data
5. Sharing your personal data
6. Data retention
7. Transfer to other countries
8. Keeping your personal data safe

10. Changes to this Policy
11. How to contact us
1. About this Policy
This Privacy Policy describes how we process your personal data at Spotify AB. From now on, we'll call it the 'Policy'.
It applies to your use of:
all Spotify streaming services as a user. For example this includes:
your use of Spotify on any device
the personalisation of your user experience. Watch our personalisation explainer video to learn more about this
the infrastructure required to provide our services
connection of your Spotify account with another application
both our free or paid streaming options (each a 'Service Option')
other Spotify services which include a link to this Policy. These include Spotify websites, Customer Service and the Community Site
From now on, we'll collectively call these the 'Spotify Service'.
From time to time, we may develop new or offer additional services. They'll also be subject to this Policy, unless stated otherwise when we introduce them.
This Policy is not...
the Spotify Terms of Use, which is a separate document. The Terms of Use outline the legal contract between you and Spotify for using the Spotify Service. It also describes the rules of Spotify and your user rights
about your use of other Spotify services which have their own privacy policy. Other Spotify services include Anchor, Soundtrap, Megaphone and the Spotify Live app
Other resources and settings
Key information about your personal data is right here in this Policy. However, you might want to take a look at our other privacy resources and controls:
Privacy Center: A user-friendly hub with summaries of key topics and helpful videos. It includes the 'Your Privacy Controls' video which shows you how to exercise your user rights and make choices about the way we process your data. See Section 2 'Your personal data rights and controls' for more on user rights.
Account Privacy: Control the processing of certain personal data, including tailored advertising.
Notification Settings: Set which marketing communications you get from Spotify.
Settings (found in the Desktop and Mobile versions of Spotify): Control certain aspects of the Spotify Service such as 'Social' or 'Explicit Content'. On the 'Social' setting, you can:
start a Private session
choose whether to share what you listen to on Spotify with your followers
choose whether to show your recently played artists on your public profile
On the 'Explicit Content' setting you can control whether explicit-rated content can be played on your Spotify account.
Cookies Policy: Information on how we use cookies and how to manage your cookie preferences. Cookies are files saved on your phone, tablet or computer when you visit a website.
2. Your personal data rights and controls
Many privacy laws give rights to individuals over their personal data. These laws include the General Data Protection Regulation, or 'GDPR'.
Some rights only apply when Spotify uses a certain 'legal basis' to process your data. We explain each legal basis, and when Spotify uses each one, in Section 4 'Our purpose for using your personal data'.
The table below explains:
your rights
circumstances when they apply (such as the legal basis required)
how to use them
You can also watch our video about Your Privacy Controls.
It’s your right to...
How?
Be informed
Be informed of the personal data we process about you and how we process it.
We inform you:

through this Policy
through information provided to you as you use the Spotify Service
by answering your specific questions and requests when you contact us
Access
Request access to the personal data we process about you.

To request a copy of your personal data from Spotify, either:

use the “Download your data” tool on your Account Privacy page, or
contact us

When you download your data you will receive the information about your data that Spotify has to provide under Article 15 of the GDPR. If you would like more information about how we process your personal data, you can contact us.
Rectification
Request that we amend or update your personal data where it’s inaccurate or incomplete.
You can edit your User Data under ‘Edit profile’ in your account or by contacting us.
Erasure
Request that we erase certain of your personal data.

For example, you can ask us to erase personal data:

that we no longer need for the purpose it was collected for
that we process based on the legal basis of consent, and you withdraw your consent
when you object (see section ‘Object’ below) and
you make a justified objection, or
you object to direct marketing

There are situations where Spotify is unable to delete your data, for example when:

it’s still necessary to process the data for the purpose we collected it for
Spotify’s interest in using the data overrides your interest in having it deleted. For example, where we need the data to protect our services from fraud
Spotify has a legal obligation to keep the data, or
Spotify needs the data to establish, exercise or defend legal claims. For example, if there’s an unresolved issue relating to your account
There are several ways you can erase personal data from Spotify:

to remove audio content from your profile select the relevant content and choose to remove it. For example, you can remove playlists from your profile, or remove a track from your playlist
to request erasure of your other personal data from Spotify, follow the steps on our support page. This data includes your User Data, Usage Data and other data listed in Section 3 ‘Personal data we collect about you’
you can also contact us to request erasure
Restriction
Request that we stop processing all or some of your personal data.

You can do this if:

your personal data is inaccurate
our processing is unlawful
we do not need your information for a specific purpose, or
you object to our processing and we are assessing your objection request. See section ‘Object’ below

You can request that we stop this processing temporarily or permanently.
You can exercise your right to restriction by contacting us.
Object
Object to us processing your personal data.

You can do this if:

Spotify is processing your personal data on the legal basis of legitimate interests, or
Spotify is processing your personal data for tailored advertising
To exercise your right to object, you can:

use controls on the Spotify Service to switch off or adjust some features which process your personal data. See the end of this section on how you can control tailored advertising
contact us
Data portability
Request a copy of your personal data in electronic format and the right to transmit that personal data for use in another party’s service.

You can request us to transmit your data when we are processing your personal data on the legal bases of consent or performance of contract. However Spotify will try to honour any request to the extent possible.
For information about how to exercise the right to portability, see ‘Access’ above.
Not be subject to automated decision making
Not be subject to a decision based solely on automated decision making (decisions without human involvement), including profiling, where the decision would have a legal effect on you or produce a similarly significant effect.
Spotify does not carry out this type of automated decision making in the Spotify Service.
Withdrawal of consent
Withdraw your consent to us collecting or using your personal data.

You can do this if Spotify is processing your personal data on the legal basis of consent.
To withdraw your consent, you can:

adjust the relevant control on Spotify
contact us
Right to lodge a complaint
Contact the Swedish Authority for Privacy Protection or your local data protection authority about any questions or concerns.
You can find the Swedish Authority’s details here. You can also go to the website of your local data protection authority.
Tailored advertising controls
What is tailored advertising?
This is when we use information about you to tailor ads to be more relevant to you. This is also known as interest based advertising.
An example of tailored advertising is when an advertising partner has information suggesting you like cars. This could enable us to show you ads about cars.
How to control tailored advertising:
You can control tailored advertising on your Account Privacy page under 'Tailored Ads'.
You can also control tailored advertising for some podcasts using the link in the episode's show description. This applies where the content provider inserts advertising into the podcast to fund it. The hosting provider, which might not be Spotify, manages these controls for the podcast.
If you are 'opted out' of Tailored Ads on your Account Privacy page, you may still get advertising. This can include on our free Service Option, as well as our paid Service Option, as applicable (for example, advertising in podcasts). This type of advertising is based on your registration information and what you are currently listening to on our services. For example, if you are listening to a cooking podcast, you may hear an ad for a food processor.

6. Data retention
We keep your personal data only as long as necessary to provide you with the Spotify Service and for Spotify's legitimate and essential business purposes, such as:
maintaining the performance of the Spotify Service
making data-driven business decisions about new features and offerings
complying with our legal obligations
resolving disputes
Here are some of the categories of our retention periods, and the criteria we use to determine them:
Data retained until you remove it
It's your right to request that we delete certain of your personal data. See the section on 'Erasure' in Section 2 'Your personal data rights and controls' for more information, and the circumstances in which we can act on your request.
You can also delete certain personal data directly from the Spotify Service: for example, you can edit or delete your profile picture. Where users are able to see and update the personal data themselves, we keep the information for as long as the user chooses unless one of the limited purposes described below applies.
Data that expires after a specific period of time
We have set certain retention periods so that some data expires after a specific period of time. For example, personal data you may input as part of search queries is generally deleted after 90 days.
Data retained until your Spotify account is deleted
We keep some data until your Spotify account is deleted. Examples of this include your Spotify username and profile information. We also typically keep streaming history for the life of an account, for example, to provide retrospective playlists that users enjoy and personalised recommendations that take listening habits into account (for example, Your Time Capsule or Your Summer Rewind). When your Spotify account is deleted, this category of your data is deleted or de-identified.
Data retained for extended time periods for limited purposes
After your account is deleted, we keep some data for a longer time period but for very limited purposes. For example, we may be subject to legal or contractual obligations that require this. These may include mandatory data retention laws, government orders to preserve data relevant to an investigation, or data kept for the purposes of litigation. We may also keep data that has been removed from the Spotify Service for a limited period of time. This could be:
to help ensure user safety, or
to protect against harmful content on our platform.
This helps us investigate potential breaches of our User Guidelines and Platform Rules. On the other hand, we will remove unlawful content if the law requires us to do so.
7. Transfer to other countries
Because of the global nature of our business, your personal data will be shared internationally among Spotify group companies, subcontractors and partners when carrying out the activities described in this Policy. They may process your data in countries whose data protection laws are not considered to be as strong as EU laws or the laws which apply where you live. For example, they may not give you the same rights over your data.
Whenever we transfer personal data internationally, we use tools to:
make sure the data transfer complies with applicable law
help to give your data the same level of protection as it has in the EU
To ensure each data transfer complies with applicable EU legislation, we use the following legal mechanisms:
Standard Contractual Clauses ('SCCs'). These clauses require the other party to protect your data and to provide you with EU-level rights and protections. For example, we use SCCs to transfer the personal data described in Section 3 'Personal data we collect about you' to our hosting provider which uses servers in the US. You can exercise your rights under the Standard Contractual Clauses by contacting us or the third party who processes your personal data.
Adequacy Decisions. This means that we transfer personal data to countries outside of the European Economic Area which have adequate laws to protect personal data, as determined by the European Commission. For example, we transfer the personal data described in Section 3 'Personal data we collect about you' to vendors based in the United Kingdom, Canada, Japan, Republic of Korea and Switzerland.
We also identify and use additional protections as appropriate for each data transfer. For example, we use:
technical protections, such as encryption and pseudonymisation
policies and processes to challenge disproportionate or unlawful government authority requests
8. Keeping your personal data safe
We're committed to protecting our users' personal data. We put in place appropriate technical and organisational measures to help protect the security of your personal data. However, be aware that no system is ever completely secure.
We have put various safeguards in place including pseudonymisation, encryption such as Transport Layer Security (TLS) and AES, access, and retention policies to guard against unauthorised access and unnecessary retention of personal data in our systems. In addition, personal data stored in our computer systems are secured by physical security measures.
To protect your user account, we encourage you to:
use a strong password which you only use for your Spotify account
never share your password with anyone
limit access to your computer and browser
log out once you have finished using the Spotify Service on a shared device
read more detail on protecting your account
You can log out of Spotify in multiple places at once by using the 'Sign out everywhere' function on your account page.
If other individuals have access to your Spotify account, then they can access personal data, controls and the Spotify Service available in your account. For example, you might have allowed someone to use your account on a shared device.
It's your responsibility to only allow individuals to use your account where you're comfortable sharing this personal data with them. Anyone else's use of your Spotify account may impact your personalised recommendations and be included in your data download.
9. Children
Note: This Policy doesn't apply to Spotify Kids unless the Spotify Kids Privacy Policy says so. Spotify Kids is a separate Spotify application.
The Spotify Service has a minimum 'Age Limit' in each country or region. The Spotify Service is not directed to children whose age:
is under the age of 13 years
makes it illegal to process their personal data, or
requires parental consent to process their personal data
We do not knowingly collect or use personal data from children under the applicable Age Limit. If you're under the Age Limit, do not use the Spotify Service, and do not provide any personal data to us. Instead, we recommend using a Spotify Kids account.
If you're a parent of a child under the Age Limit and become aware that your child has provided personal data to Spotify, contact us.
If we learn that we've collected the personal data of a child under the applicable Age Limit, we'll take reasonable steps to delete the personal data. This may require us to delete the Spotify account for that child.
When using a shared device on the main Spotify Service, be cautious about playing or recommending any inappropriate content to individuals under 18 years old.
10. Changes to this Policy
We may occasionally make changes to this Policy.
When we make material changes to this Policy, we'll provide you with prominent notice as appropriate under the circumstances. For example, we may display a prominent notice within the Spotify Service or send you an email or device notification.
11. How to contact us
For any questions or concerns about this Policy, contact our Grievance Officer/Data Protection Officer any one of these ways:
email privacy@spotify.com
write to us at: Spotify, Regeringsgatan 19, 111 53 Stockholm, Sweden
For the purposes of the GDPR, Spotify AB is the data controller of personal data processed under this Policy.

This policy describes how Spotify uses cookies. From now on, we'll call it the 'Policy'. The purpose of this Policy is to provide you, a user of Spotify's services and/or websites (we'll collectively call these the 'Services'), with clear information about the purposes for which Spotify uses cookies and the choices you have when it comes to managing your cookie settings.
1. What are cookies?
Cookies are small pieces of text which are downloaded to your device, for example, when you visit a website. Cookies are useful because they allow Spotify and our partners to uniquely recognise your device and support the continuity of your experience, for example by helping us to understand your preferences or past actions. You can find more general information about cookies at: www.allaboutcookies.org.
2. How do we use cookies?
Cookies do lots of different jobs, like letting you navigate between pages efficiently, remembering your preferences, and generally improving your user experience. They can also help to ensure that ads you see online are more relevant to you and your interests.
Spotify uses two main categories of cookie: (1) strictly necessary cookies; and (2) optional cookies:
1. Strictly Necessary Cookies
These cookies are set by Spotify or a third party on our behalf, and are essential to enable you to use the features of our Services, such as technically delivering content, setting your privacy preferences, logging in, making payments or filling in forms. Without these cookies, our Services cannot be provided so you cannot decline them.
2. Optional Cookies
Optional cookies may be 'first party cookies' or 'third party cookies'. First party cookies set directly by Spotify or by a third party at our request. Third party cookies are set directly by a third party or set by Spotify at the request of a third party, such as our analytics or advertising service providers. You can see a list of these partners at this link. Spotify, or our partners, use optional cookies in the following ways:
Cookie Type
Purpose
Strictly Necessary Cookies
These cookies are essential in order to enable you to use the features of our Services, such as technically delivering content, setting your privacy preferences, logging in, making payments or filling in forms. Without these cookies, our Services cannot be provided so you cannot decline them.
Performance Cookies
These cookies collect information about how visitors use our Services. For example, these cookies allow us to count visits to our website and to understand how visitors found the website.
Web analytics that use cookies to gather data to enhance the performance of a website fall into this category. For example, they may be used for testing designs and ensuring a consistent look and feel is maintained for the user. We may also obtain information from our email newsletters or other communications we send to you, including whether you opened or forwarded a newsletter or clicked on any of its content. This information tells us about our newsletters' effectiveness and helps us ensure that we're delivering information that you find interesting.
This category does not include cookies used for behavioural/interest-based targeted advertising networks.
Functional
These cookies allow our Services to remember choices you make such as your user name, language or the region you are in and provide enhanced, more personal features and content. For example, these cookies can be used to remember changes you have made to parts of web pages that you can customise.
These cookies remember choices you make to improve your experience. If you do not allow these cookies then some of the choices you have made on previous visits to our Services will not be saved.
Targeting or advertising Cookies
These cookies collect information about your browsing habits in order to deliver advertisements more relevant to you and to understand your interests. They are also used to limit the number of times you see an advertisement as well as help measure the effectiveness of the advertisements Spotify shares. These cookies log that you have visited a website and this information may be shared with other organisations such as advertisers. Additionally, Spotify may share limited data with other platforms to market Spotify promotions, features, or new releases on those other platforms. If you do not allow these cookies you will still experience advertising but it will be less tailored to you.
3. Options for managing cookies and interest-based ads
Web Browser Settings
You can use your web browser settings to accept, refuse and delete cookies. To do this, follow the instructions provided by your browser (usually located within the 'Help', 'Tools' or 'Edit' settings).
Please note that if you set your browser to refuse cookies, you may not be able to use all the features of the Spotify website. To find out more information, you can visit www.allaboutcookies.org.
Mobile Identifiers
On your mobile device, your operating system may provide you with additional options to opt out of interest based advertising or to otherwise reset your mobile identifiers. For example, you may use the 'Allow Apps to Request to Track' setting (on iOS devices) or the 'Opt out of Interest-Based Ads' setting (on Android devices). These settings allow you to limit the use of information about your use of apps for purposes of serving ads tailored to your interests.
Interest-Based Advertising
You may opt-out of receiving interest-based advertisements by turning off the 'Tailored ads' toggle, located in the Privacy Settings page of your Spotify Account. If you opt-out of receiving interest-based ads using the Tailored ads toggle, Spotify will not share your information with third party advertising partners or use information received by them to show you interest-based ads. You may still receive ads when using the Services based on your Spotify registration information and your real-time usage of Spotify, but the ads may be less relevant to you.
Certain tailored advertisements that we, or a service provider acting on our behalf, display to you may include the 'Ad Choices' icon or another mechanism to opt out of receiving interest-based advertisements. You may click on the AdChoices icon or visit www.aboutads.info to:
learn more about the collection and use of information about your online activities for interest based advertising; or
opt out of having your data used for interest based advertising by Digital Advertising Alliance (DAA) participating companies.
4. Updates to this Policy
We may occasionally make changes to this Policy.
When we make material changes to this Policy, we'll provide you with prominent notice as appropriate under the circumstances. For example, we may display a prominent notice within the Spotify Services or send you an email or device notification.
