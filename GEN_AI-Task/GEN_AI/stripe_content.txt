Read the guide GuidesCard_10 Product resources A guide to payment methods Case studies WooCommerce partners with Stripe to launch in 17 new countries in 3 months WooCommerce is one of the most popular e-commerce platforms in the world, enabling WordPress businesses to sell and manage orders directly from their websites. Challenge WooCommerce already had a long-time partnership with Stripe for core payment processing capabilities, but realised it could further leverage Stripe to empower its merchants to offer local payment methods. Solution WooCommerce set out to expand its platform offering to match the rapidly evolving needs of its merchants. To do this, it decided to launch a brand new platform, WooCommerce Payments, by integrating several different Stripe products – including Connect, Instant Payouts, Terminal, and Billing. Products Terminal Billing Connect Payments 23 payment methods Stripe enabled us to get WooCommerce Payments to market fast. In three months, we were live in 17 additional countries. The fact that we were able to support merchants in so many markets that quickly is huge. Britni McCotter , Head of Payment Business Operations WooCommerce logo Amazon simplifies cross-border payments with Stripe Amazon set out to build a payments infrastructure that not only delivers an innovative and personalised checkout experience, but also a set of payments services that power Amazon’s portfolio of products and businesses around the world. Challenge As Amazon expanded into new geographies, it sought to bring a new level of simplicity to international payments. Solution Amazon partnered with Stripe to streamline global payments experiences, particularly as the company looked to launch in new countries quickly. For example, when Amazon expanded into Poland, the team worked with Stripe to optimise the checkout experience with BLIK, a popular local payment method in the region. Products Connect Payments 6 payment methods One of the things we really valued about Stripe is it got us into a lot of different countries quickly and helped lower the barrier of entry for us. Ben Volk , Director, Global Payment Acceptance & Customer Experience Amazon logo Bodum expands globally by leveraging local payment methods with Stripe Bodum is a kitchenware manufacturer producing high-quality coffee and tea solutions and household accessories. It creates functional designs at affordable prices with a strong focus on sustainability and environmental responsibility. Challenge With the majority of customers ordering from a mobile device, Bodum was looking to build a seamless online customer experience for both desktop and mobile. Solution Bodum localised its checkout experience to scale its online business to 23 countries across Europe, America, Australia, and Asia. Implementing Stripe Elements took less than a month initially, and Bodum can now turn on any new payment methods that become available, directly from the Dashboard with no additional engineering required. Products Elements 20+ payment methods Mobile checkout is the future, but the distraction rate is very high. If a customer is buying something through a mobile site and they get another notification, the risk of losing that purchase is high. Local payment methods are really important to help customers complete their purchase as quickly as possible. Peter Bodum , E-Commerce Manager Bodum logo Deliveroo expands globally and launches new revenue stream with Stripe Founded in the United Kingdom in 2013, Deliveroo is a leading on-demand food delivery service that works with more than 115,000 restaurant and grocery partners across 12 markets. Solution Since moving to Stripe, all of Deliveroo’s markets, which include the United Kingdom, Singapore, Spain, and Hong Kong, have grown exponentially. Deliveroo also leveraged Stripe to provide localised payment methods in 2020, including Apple Pay, Google Pay, China Union Pay (for accounts in the UK, Australia, Hong Kong, and Singapore), Dutch payment method iDeal, Bancontact in Belgium, and Cartes Bancaires for French accounts. Products Billing Radar Sigma 10 payment methods In seven years we went from saying, ‘These APIs look great – let’s see how this goes,’ to building a deep strategic relationship with Stripe.

} ~ Increase trust & safety Reduce the number of scammers and bad actors to increase the credibility of your marketplace or community. Reduce fraud losses Help your risk teams securely collect identity information to determine if a user is legitimate or fraudulent. Streamline KYC Make it easy for users to prove their identity at onboarding while fulfilling a crucial part of your compliance requirements. Prevent account takeovers Add a layer of security before allowing high-risk features or if you notice suspicious activities in an account. Clubhouse logo Discord logo Peerspace logo Shippo logo How it works Confirm identities with confidence Stripe Identity is built on top of technology that Stripe uses to verify millions of global users. It's a part of our own global Know Your Customer (KYC) process, risk operations, and more. Verify global users Fragmented government ID standards make it challenging to verify identities for global users. With Stripe Identity, you can confidently verify the authenticity of ID documents from over 100 countries . Capture IDs with a conversion-optimised verification flow Retrieve extracted data from documents Access collected images of ID documents and selfies Maximise conversion Poor image capture is the most common reason legitimate users are mistakenly rejected. Stripe Identity guides users through photo-taking and automatically scores each frame to select the most readable image, maximising success rates. Try it out Move your ID document into this area Capture in progress… Detect fraudulent users Stripe Identity is built on the same technology we use to defend against attacks on our own global network. We’ve optimised our fraud prevention system with learnings from over a decade of experience fending off sophisticated fraudsters, and we are constantly updating our models to prevent the latest attack vectors. Detect fake IDs and spoofed photos with machine learning Match the ID photo with selfies of the document holder Validate SSN and addresses against global databases Fully integrated Built on the Stripe network By centralising ID verification with core business operations such as payments , subscriptions and payouts , your engineering team can save time on integration, and your operational team can spend less time hopping between systems. Fight fraud with multi-layered verifications Once Stripe Identity confirms a user’s identity, Financial Connections can verify the user owns a linked bank account to reduce the risk of account takeovers. Customise verifications on your platform Embed ID verification using our pre-built libraries and SDKs . Platforms and marketplaces can configure Connect Onboarding to collect additional verifications based on their own risk signals. We decided to build the Verified Bot programme on Stripe Identity for 3 reasons: the user experience was seamless, integration was easier since we’re already using Stripe for payments, and our users trusted Stripe to help keep their identity information safe and secure. Mason Sciotti , Product Manager for Dev Ecosystem, Discord Discord logo We were able to easily update our existing Connect onboarding experience to collect additional verifications using Stripe Identity. This allows us to control payouts based on verification status to reduce fraud, while keeping our hosts on a single, consistent experience that’s powered by Stripe. Matt Bendett , VP Operations, Peerspace Peerspace logo Stripe Identity helps our fraud team avoid hours of manual labour and reduces the risk of exposing sensitive user data. The entire verification process is now much faster and easier for legitimate users. Simon Kreuz , Co-founder, Shippo Shippo logo With Stripe Identity, we were able to build a progressive verification experience. We start with an ID number check, and if that fails we automatically ask for an ID document. This lets us keep our community safe without adding unnecessary friction. Andrea Barrett , Co-founder, UrbanSitter UrbanSitter logo Discord logo Peerspace logo Shippo logo UrbanSitter logo Keep user data safe Security and privacy at the core Stripe Identity is based on expertise we’ve developed from building a global infrastructure that handles hundreds of billions of dollars in payments annually.

Challenge Slalom shared a goal to accelerate the development of its Stripe practice and arm its consultants with Stripe business solutions and technical expertise that would bring incremental value to customers. Slalom knew that building this on its own would require significant investment – so they looked to the Stripe Partner Ecosystem for support. Solution Slalom invested in its people to complete Stripe’s technical training and certifications, specifically designed for architects and developers, to provide them with real-world applications and implementation best practices from Stripe experts. Impact In just a few months, Slalom has trained over 26 of its implementation architects and engineers through Stripe’s training and certifications – efficiently enabling its teams to become productive and revenue generating. The relationships that we have forged between our two teams are meaningful and benefit us both as we continue to work together on transformative projects. We’ve identified our path to success as working with Stripe and building a lasting partnership. TC Sutton , managing director at Slalom Slalom logo How Woo partnered with Stripe to launch payments WooCommerce is one of the most popular e-commerce platforms in the world, enabling WordPress businesses to sell and manage orders directly from their websites. Challenge As Woo prepared to launch its WooPayments brand, the company looked to Stripe for co-marketing guidance and resources to confidently market a payments solution that would resonate with its merchants. Solution Woo leveraged best practices from Stripe’s marketing toolkit and customised the messaging for its own channels. This saved the team hours from creating content and strategy, allowing them to execute these campaigns and see results quickly. Impact Woo launched its payments product to 18 countries in just three months – and with a team of fewer than 20 people. With anything related to Woo and Stripe, our approach to marketing is ‘all channels go.’ Stripe helps us position the different features and understand which channels are more advantageous, and it’s been inspiring to see the response from the market. Clara Lee , VP of product & operations at Woo WooCommerce logo How aye4fin partnered with Stripe to gain strategic sales advantage aye4fin is a global consulting company specialising in the areas of payment and e-commerce to establish outstanding and scalable payment solutions. Challenge When approached by an international travel platform, consulting partner aye4fin engaged Stripe in joint sales activation to provide its client with an integrated and cross-border payments solution that best aligned with its business objectives. Solution aye4fin combined its industry expertise and close partnership with Stripe to position itself as the best implementation and development provider for its client’s needs. Impact aye4fin won its client over and helped it to go live in just a few months. It continues to be a strategic thought partner to the client for ongoing support and customisation work. Our goal as technology-agnostic experts is to always aim to identify the best-in-class solutions for our clients in order to provide them with positive commerce experiences.

Case studies Italic brings the luxury of one-click checkouts with Stripe Italic offers unbranded, atelier-grade essentials produced using the same manufacturers and materials as top luxury houses, but without the markup.

Products Link Tax Issuing Radar Payments Castlery uses Stripe to streamline operations Castlery is a direct-to-consumer furniture brand that needed a partner to help them centralise purchases online and in-person across the globe. Challenge Castlery sold products both online and offline in physical showrooms. Transactions processed in-store required purchase information to be manually copied over into Castlery’s internal systems, which created unnecessary overhead for their team members. Solution Castlery migrated their entire payments system to Stripe. By having a unified view of their customers across channels, they were able to personalise support, speed up financial reconciliation, and accelerate their refund process from weeks to days.

Zhiwei Zhou , Cofounder and CTO Castlery logo Dermalogica uses Stripe to prevent fraud Dermalogica is a professional skincare brand that needed help preventing fraudsters from making purchases without blocking legitimate customers. Challenge Skincare and cosmetic brands are often targets for fraud due to the high resale value of their products. In addition, Dermalogica’s mix of professional and consumer sales meant that a one-size-fits-all fraud solution would not work for them. Solution Dermalogica worked with Stripe to tailor fraud prevention to their unique customer base made up of both individual consumers and professional buyers with large order sizes. In just 6 months, they were able to cut fraud in half, while keeping the checkout experience smooth and frictionless for legitimate customers. Read the full story.

It was especially important for it to create an intuitive buying experience for customers who are forced to use online ordering for the first time. Solution Using Stripe, the Waitrose team created a checkout flow that adapts to the user’s device, automatically displays card number inputs to directly match the formatting on the end customer’s card, and offers a numerical keypad on mobile when appropriate.

Reduce involuntary churn Nearly a quarter of churn is involuntary – it’s caused by missed payments or declined cards. Stripe’s recovery tools help businesses recover 57% of failed recurring payments on average, and businesses using our Smart Retries recover 11% more revenue than those retrying failed payments on a set schedule. Stripe’s recovery tools helped our users recover $3.42 billion in revenue last year. For involuntary churn, we have found that Stripe Smart Retries have really worked for us. They’re built into Stripe Billing and use machine learning to retry cards at the optimal time. We’ve recovered millions of dollars in revenue that we would have otherwise lost – this is very substantial for us as a subscription business. Nadia Ali , CFO, Midjourney Midjourney logo Smart Retries Stripe uses machine learning to choose optimal times to retry failed payments which may increase the chance of success. 90% of the cards used on the Stripe network have been seen more than once. Automatic reminders and one-click updates Enable automated emails for failed or overdue payments. Plus give your customers a secure, one-click option for updating their payment method in the hosted recovery page. Automatic card updater Stripe works directly with card networks ( where available ) to update payment details when a card expires or is replaced. Recovery analytics Monitor and analyse subscription payment failures and recovery rates, measure the effectiveness of all recovery efforts in a single view, and investigate trends using downloadable reports directly from the Dashboard. Optimise the customer lifecycle Use Stripe as a system of record for the customer lifecycle: manage important events such as automatically provisioning services for new subscribers or sending reminders for renewals. You can also enable your customers to self-manage their subscriptions with the customer portal.

Kelly Hofmann , Revenue Accounting Slack logo Sigma gives us legitimate evidence to challenge a chargeback, whereas before Stripe, we had no visibility whatsoever. The new level of data and insight we can get out of Stripe compared to what we could get previously is just night and day. It really helped us improve and speed up our decision-making. Jez Bristow , Chief Product Manager Green Flag logo With a query that took less than 5 minutes to write, our team has been able to identify unpaid invoices and recapture tens of thousands of dollars of revenue – 8 percent of failed payments – in just two months. Steven Moldavskiy , Business Intelligence Harri logo Before Stripe Sigma, we built our own tool to analyse our Stripe data, but it took our engineers weeks to build, required ongoing work to maintain and update, and it wasn’t always accurate.

Watch now Case studies Slack uses Stripe to automate payments & billing Slack is a channel-based messaging platform that needed help automating custom billing schedules and allowing customers to update their own plans. Challenge To meet rapidly growing demand, Slack expanded to serve more global customers and large-scale enterprises. Among other challenges, Slack needed to support a variety of payment methods in different regions, set up automation for a custom, usage-based invoicing system, and let customers adjust their own plans. Solution In just 2 weeks, Slack worked with Stripe to launch a new system that automated all their billing and payment collection needs across 15 countries. It dramatically reduced engineering time spent on maintaining an in-house system and helped their operational team spend less time responding to custom pricing requests. Read the full story. Products Payments Billing Radar Sigma Having a billing system that lets you stay nimble to respond to customers' needs is really critical. Stripe gives you that flexibility. Jackie Rocca , Director of Product, Slack Slack logo Twilio partnered with Stripe to increase revenue Twilio is a communication platform that needed a partner to help them improve global payments performance to increase conversion and revenue. Challenge As Twilio expanded globally, they needed a payment processor equipped to handle international transactions at scale with high authorisation rates to maximise revenue uplift, reduce issuer declines, and reduce involuntary churn. Solution Twilio ran an A/B test with multiple major global payment processors monitoring authorisation rates across card networks. After weeks of testing, they saw a 10% uplift overall in authorisation rates from working with Stripe. Read the full story. Products Payments Sigma It requires zero effort from our side. It’s purely done on the engineering efforts of Stripe. Chris Nasson , Director of Investor Relations & Treasury at Twilio Twilio logo Typeform uses Stripe to launch flexible pricing plans Typeform is a form builder that wanted to quickly launch new pricing as they developed new products, entered new markets, and closed custom deals. Challenge Typeform needed to implement a global billing system that would allow charging monthly and annual subscription fees. Solution Typeform rebuilt their billing system on Stripe, which let them launch a new set of subscription plans – billed monthly or annually. They can now automate customer upgrades, send recurring invoices, collect payments in multiple currencies, and handle financial reporting without manual intervention. Read the full story.

Challenge Booksy was deeply embedded with a payment provider that wasn't meeting expectations, driving some businesses to less secure payment methods as a workaround. Booksy wanted a more robust omnichannel payment offering with a broader range of use cases to keep up with the evolving needs of its providers. Solution Stripe professional services helped Booksy replace its payment provider within five months, providing key business guidance and working closely with Booksy engineers, helping it achieve its vision of a complete payments platform where providers can manage payments entirely through their Booksy account. Booksy migrated tens of thousands of connected provider accounts to Stripe overnight with a 97% success rate. Products Connect Payments Elements Radar Stripe professional services was a huge help in integrating with Stripe. And it went beyond just answering minor questions – it included a large range of services and constant consulting on new ideas. We talked through issues and received guidance on how to use different products. On a scale of one to 10, we’d give professional services an 11. Pawel Tama , Payments Project Manager Booksy logo Lynk & Co partners with Stripe experts to create a hassle-free payment experience Lynk & Co is a Swedish automobile company that makes driving easy by offering drivers flexible mobility options. Drivers can access vehicles through a subscription model, car-sharing, or by purchasing their own car. Lynk & Co provides various services to help drivers maintain their vehicles, such as insurance, maintenance, and more. Challenge Lynk & Co wanted a new payment provider to ensure compliance with the EU’s Payment Services Directive (PSD2) and provide a seamless payment experience to more effectively convert Lynk & Co’s riders and drivers. Solution Lynk & Co partnered with Stripe professional services for guidance to accelerate a complex Stripe Connect integration to power Lynk & Co’s PSD2-compliant payments platform. Lynk & Co’s car-sharing offering launched across all seven active markets in a single day. Six months following its launch, Lynk & Co saw increases across its major offerings: 53% for car borrowers, 45% for car sharers, and 49% for car-sharing bookings. Products Connect Payments Stripe professional services got involved early, joining technical discussions, offering solutions, and bringing in expertise from across the Stripe family. The team was engaged, flexible, and knowledgeable. As a result, our Connect implementation is absolutely stronger due to our partnership with professional services.

It’s on a mission to inspire the world to start selling and to make second-hand the first choice by simplifying peer-to-peer buying and selling. Challenge Following Carousell’s Stripe Connect implementation, its trust and safety team gathered data about its most common fraud attack vectors. Carousell created a strategy with Stripe professional services to combat fraud threats specific to its business to boost reaction time, improve customer experience, and further global expansion. Solution Through a 10-week fraud strategy advisory, Carousell worked with Stripe professional services to build and refine its trust and safety processes by creating user personas to identify its most significant threats, risks, and mitigation opportunities. After implementing the new fraud processes, Carousell has seen a reduction in detection and reaction times, as well as a 75% reduction in false positives, a 15% reduction in 3D Secure (3DS) interventions, a 10% increase in issuer authorisation rates, and reduced early payment blocks.

Challenge Impulse Creative needed a way to digitise B2B payments for its coaching and training clients without the traditional “cart” experience. Solution HubSpot built a native payments solution, powered by Stripe, into its CRM – allowing Impulse Creative to create custom products and embed payment links into its landing pages in real time. Impact Impulse Creative saw a 16% uplift from visit-to-payment conversions on its landing page. We've been astounded by the ease of setup of HubSpot's payments functionality. The ability to create custom products, streamline, and embed the payment experience into landing pages has been amazing. Remington Begg , chief remarkable officer at Impulse Creative ImpulseCreative logo Cabiri helps River Island improve authorization rates by 4% River Island is a multi-channel fashion brand with 245 stores across the UK and a significant online presence that reaches more than 125 global markets. Challenge Founded in 1948, River Island was facing competition from new online retailers. It needed customer-centric, high-tech solutions for an omnichannel customer journey. Solution River Island engaged Cabiri, an IT consultancy, to help implement several Stripe products to replace its fragmented system, including Stripe Payments, Stripe Elements, and Stripe Terminal. Stripe now processes all self-service checkouts in River Island stores, as well as 100% of the retailer’s online sales. Impact River Island has seen a 4% uplift in authorisation rates and a 2% uplift in customers moving from order review to completing a transaction. Now that more customers are completing checkout and more submitted payments are being approved, River Island anticipates a boost in revenue. Over the first 12 months of our partnership with Stripe, we will capture millions more value in sales than we previously would have. Emily Haddrell , Digital Product Lead, River Island RiverIsland logo How KINTO uses Nova Module to save its team 6+ hours per day KINTO is a Japan-based producer of home and lifestyle goods dedicated to creating thoughtful objects that bring comfort and inspiration to its customers’ everyday lives. Challenge KINTO USA had to manually reconcile payments and invoices between Stripe and NetSuite, which was a time-consuming and inefficient process. It needed a way to streamline operations, enhance customer support, and drive growth in the US. Solution To seamlessly process transactions, synchronise records, and more, KINTO USA used PayPack, a no-code NetSuite solution developed by Nova Module. Impact With PayPack, KINTO was able to connect Stripe with NetSuite in just a few days, saving more than six hours daily in manual payment processing tasks. This improved customer satisfaction, accelerated order processing, and enabled KINTO to expand its offering of local payment methods. We work on a prepaid model, so orders aren’t shipped until they’re paid. With PayPack and Stripe, we’ve become super efficient in sending payment links and receiving those payments. The faster we can process payments, the faster we can ship products, and the faster KINTO can grow. Denis Dumas-Meseguer , Chief Strategy Officer, KINTO USA Kinto logo How Maropost helped Bikes Online expand into new markets Founded in Sydney, Australia, Bikes Online is a direct-to-consumer online retailer of road bikes, mountain bikes, and bike gear. Challenge Bikes Online needed an effective, customisable fraud prevention system as well as solutions capable of supporting the company’s growth into new geographies. Solution Maropost provided a one-stop solution for inventory management, order management, and shipping labelling. They offer a seamless checkout and payment experience for customers with Stripe, resulting in faster checkout times and access to more payment methods. Impact Bikes Online has seen a 10x of its US business since launch, $40,000 uplift in accepted transactions per month, and $10,000 savings per month in fraud prevention costs in each market. What surprised me most about Stripe and Maropost is the human connection. We’ve had the chance to work with a highly engaged team that is passionate about building our business and helping solve problems quickly.

Frequently asked questions About GitHub Premium Support What is GitHub Premium Support for? GitHub Premium Support helps customers implement GitHub Enterprise quickly and effectively across the organization with 24/7 support. How much does GitHub Premium Support cost? For pricing information, please get in touch with the GitHub Premium Support Sales sales team. What are the levels of support in GitHub Premium Support? There are three levels of support: The basic plan included with your GitHub Enterprise license GitHub Premium Support GitHub Premium Plus Support Please refer to our plan comparison table for more details. How do I contact GitHub Premium Support? If you are an existing GitHub Premium Support customer, please sign in to our support portal . If you don’t already have GitHub Premium Support, please contact sales . Choosing your plan What is escalation and incident management? Escalation and incident management is the ability to escalate ticket progression in the GitHub support portal. After someone escalates a ticket, Support Incident Coordinators orchestrate all necessary parties to resolve the ticket. Additionally, Senior Escalation Engineers (SEEs) facilitate GitHub-internal technical communications and liaise with the rest of GitHub to improve the support team’s capability in similar future circumstances. What is incident response management? Incident response management helps manage the technical resources needed for case resolution. Support Incident Coordinators are available for incident response management 24/7. What are my SLAs for initial response? GitHub Premium Support and GitHub Premium Plus Support customers have SLAs. For urgent priority tickets, your SLA guarantees a 30-minute initial response time, which includes troubleshooting. For high priority tickets, your SLA provides a four-hour initial response time. What’s included in initial troubleshooting? For initial troubleshooting, the assigned Premium Support Engineer/Customer Reliability Engineer will review and acknowledge your ticket. To better understand the issue and start troubleshooting, the engineer may ask for additional information such as screenshots, error messages, log files, diagnostics files, support bundles, or the output of specific console commands. They may also collaborate with others in support, engineering, or in the regional incident commander. If a callback was requested, the engineer will determine if screen sharing is the most effective way to drive ticket resolution. If so, they will invite you to join a screen-sharing session. How do I get health check reports? GitHub Premium Support and GitHub Premium Plus Support customers are entitled to unlimited automated health check reports. Additionally, GitHub Premium Plus Support customers can request quarterly enhanced health checks with findings, interpretations, and recommendations from a Customer Reliability Engineer (CRE). What is crisis prevention? Crisis prevention allows GitHub Enterprise Server customers to prepare for — and experience — an incident without risk. Your Customer Reliability Engineer (CRE) guides your team through an incident simulation in a safe and controlled environment. Crisis Prevention consists of up to four sessions about reliability best practices, preparing for a potential incident, and efficiently interacting with GitHub Support. After the incident simulation, your CRE will run a detailed retrospective, uncovering lessons learned and improvement suggestions for the future. How long does GitHub Premium Support take? GitHub Premium Support and GitHub Premium Plus Support Plus customers have service-level agreements (SLAs) for initial response. For urgent priority tickets, the initial response SLA guarantees a 30-minute initial response time, which includes troubleshooting. For high-priority tickets, the initial response SLA provides a four-hour time. We currently do not provide estimates for time to resolution, as the complexity of tickets varies. However, we review these metrics on a regular basis and reduce times whenever possible. How do I resolve a problem in GitHub Enterprise? You can get support via online ticket submission if you’re using the basic plan included with your GitHub Enterprise license. If you have GitHub Premium Support or GitHub Premium Plus Support, you can submit a ticket online. For urgent tickets, GitHub Premium Support and GitHub Premium Plus Support customers can request a callback and have a screen-sharing session with one of our Premium Support Engineers or Customer Reliability Engineers (CREs). Please refer to our plan comparison table for more details. Rules and policies If I do not use all the technical advisory hours in a given quarter, can they be carried over? Premium Plus customers may use up to 12 technical advisory hours per quarter. Unused technical advisory hours may not be carried over into the next quarter. How can the technical advisory support hours be used? There are multiple ways you can use technical advisory hours, including but not limited to: Consultations regarding GitHub best practices and general recommendations GitHub Enterprise Server upgrade preparation and assistance Does GitHub Premium Support provide service on weekends? Yes! GitHub Premium Support and GitHub Premium Plus Support customers receive 24/7 support. Upgrading your plan What virtual trainings are available with GitHub Premium Plus Support and who can participate? Customers get access to one virtual training class per year. Topics include: GitHub for developers GitHub for admins (Server) GitHub for admins (Cloud) GitHub for non-developers GH API Training GH Actions Fundamentals GH Actions Intermediate GH Copilot Fundamentals GH Copilot Intermediate GH Copilot Administration & Security GitHub Enterprise Implementation (Server) GitHub Enterprise Implementation (Cloud) We recommend limiting training sessions to a maximum of 16 participants to ensure an optimal provider-to-participant ratio and a high-quality delivery experience. However, in specific cases where it makes sense, we can accommodate up to 20–25 participants while maintaining our commitment to delivering a valuable training experience for your team. What value will I get by upgrading to GitHub Premium Plus Support? GitHub Premium Plus Support customers get an assigned Customer Reliability Engineer (CRE), quarterly enhanced health checks, access to crisis prevention, technical advisory hours, and many additional benefits, which you can review in our plan comparison table . What’s the benefit of having a Customer Reliability Engineer (CRE) over a Premium Support Engineer? A CRE knows your customer account in detail and can help you expedite case resolution faster than a Premium Support Engineer. Since I get GitHub Enterprise Support for free, why should I upgrade to GitHub Premium Support? Most customers upgrade to GitHub Premium Support because they need initial response SLAs for urgent and high priority requests, phone support, screen share support for critical issues, and health checks.

Go to Trust Center Frequently asked questions General What is GitHub Copilot? GitHub Copilot transforms the developer experience. Backed by the leaders in AI, Copilot provides contextualized assistance throughout the software development lifecycle, from code completions and chat assistance in the IDE to code explanations and answers to docs in GitHub and more. With Copilot elevating their workflow, developers can focus on more: value, innovation, and happiness. GitHub Copilot enables developers to focus more energy on problem solving and collaboration and spend less effort on the mundane and boilerplate. That’s why developers who use Copilot report up to 75% higher satisfaction with their jobs than those who don’t and are up to 55% more productive at writing code without sacrifice to quality, which all adds up to engaged developers shipping great software faster. GitHub Copilot integrates with leading editors, including Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, JetBrains IDEs, and Neovim, and, unlike other AI coding assistants, is natively built into GitHub. Growing to millions of individual users and tens of thousands of business customers, Copilot is the world’s most widely adopted AI developer tool and the competitive advantage developers ask for by name. Who is eligible to access GitHub Copilot for free? GitHub Copilot Free is a new free pricing tier with limited functionality for individual developers. Users assigned a Copilot Business or Copilot Enterprise seat are not eligible for access. Users with access to Copilot Pro through a paid subscription, trial, or through an existing verified OSS, Student, Faculty, or MVP account may elect to use Free instead. What languages, IDEs, and platforms does GitHub Copilot support? GitHub Copilot is trained on all languages that appear in public repositories. For each language, the quality of suggestions you receive may depend on the volume and diversity of training data for that language. For example, JavaScript is well-represented in public repositories and is one of GitHub Copilot’s best supported languages. Languages with less representation in public repositories may produce fewer or less robust suggestions. GitHub Copilot is available as an extension in Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, Vim, Neovim, the JetBrains suite of IDEs, and Azure Data Studio. Although code completion functionality is available across all these extensions, chat functionality is currently available only in Visual Studio Code, JetBrains and Visual Studio. GitHub Copilot is also supported in terminals through GitHub CLI and as a chat integration in Windows Terminal Canary. With the GitHub Copilot Enterprise plan, GitHub Copilot is natively integrated into GitHub.com. All plans are supported in GitHub Copilot in GitHub Mobile. GitHub Mobile for Copilot Pro and Copilot Business have access to Bing and public repository code search. Copilot Enterprise in GitHub Mobile gives you additional access to your organization's knowledge. Does GitHub Copilot “copy/paste”? No, GitHub Copilot generates suggestions using probabilistic determination. When thinking about intellectual property and open source issues, it is critical to understand how GitHub Copilot really works. The AI models that create Copilot’s suggestions may be trained on public code, but do not contain any code. When they generate a suggestion, they are not “copying and pasting” from any codebase. To generate a code suggestion, the Copilot extension begins by examining the code in your editor—focusing on the lines just before and after your cursor, but also information including other files open in your editor and the URLs of repositories or file paths to identify relevant context. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions. To generate a suggestion for chat in the code editor, the Copilot extension creates a contextual prompt by combining your prompt with additional context including the code file open in your active document, your code selection, and general workspace information, such as frameworks, languages, and dependencies. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions. To generate a suggestion for chat on GitHub.com, such as providing an answer to a question from your chat prompt, Copilot creates a contextual prompt by combining your prompt with additional context including previous prompts, the open pages on GitHub.com as well as retrieved context from your codebase or Bing search. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions. What are the differences between the GitHub Copilot Business, GitHub Copilot Enterprise, and GitHub Copilot Individual plans? GitHub Copilot has multiple offerings for organizations and an offering for individual developers. All the offerings include both code completion and chat assistance. The primary differences between the organization offerings and the individual offering are license management, policy management, and IP indemnity. Organizations can choose between GitHub Copilot Business and GitHub Copilot Enterprise. GitHub Copilot Business primarily features GitHub Copilot in the coding environment - that is the IDE, CLI and GitHub Mobile. GitHub Copilot Enterprise includes everything in GitHub Copilot Business. It also  adds an additional layer of customization for organizations and integrates into GitHub.com as a chat interface to allow developers to converse with Copilot  throughout the platform. GitHub Copilot Enterprise can index an organization’s codebase for a deeper understanding of the customer’s knowledge for more tailored suggestions and will offer customers access to fine-tuned custom, private models for code completion. GitHub Copilot Individual is designed for individual developers, freelancers, students, educators, and open source maintainers. The plan includes all the features of GitHub Copilot Business except organizational license management, policy management, and IP indemnity. What data has GitHub Copilot been trained on? GitHub Copilot is powered by generative AI models developed by GitHub, OpenAI, and Microsoft. It has been trained on natural language text and source code from publicly available sources, including code in public repositories on GitHub. Which plan includes GitHub Copilot Autofix? GitHub Copilot Autofix provides contextual explanations and code suggestions to help developers fix vulnerabilities in code, and is included in GitHub Advanced Security . What if I do not want GitHub Copilot? Copilot is entirely optional and requires you to opt in before gaining access. You can easily configure its usage directly in the editor, enabling or disabling it at any time. Additionally, you have control over which file types Copilot is active for. How do I control access to GitHub Copilot in my company? Access to Copilot Business and Enterprise is managed by your GitHub Administrator. They can control access to preview features, models, and set Copilot policies for your organization. Additionally, you can use your network firewall to explicitly allow access to Copilot Business and/or block access to Copilot Pro or Free. For more details, refer to the documentation . Plans & Pricing What are the differences between the Free, Pro, Business, and Enterprise plans? GitHub Copilot has multiple offerings for organizations and an offering for individual developers. All the offerings include both code completion and chat assistance. The primary differences between the organization offerings and the individual offering are license management, policy management, and IP indemnity. Organizations can choose between GitHub Copilot Business and GitHub Copilot Enterprise. GitHub Copilot Business primarily features GitHub Copilot in the coding environment - that is the IDE, CLI and GitHub Mobile. GitHub Copilot Enterprise includes everything in GitHub Copilot Business. It also  adds an additional layer of customization for organizations and integrates into GitHub.com as a chat interface to allow developers to converse with Copilot  throughout the platform. GitHub Copilot Enterprise can index an organization’s codebase for a deeper understanding of the customer’s knowledge for more tailored suggestions and will offer customers access to fine-tuned custom, private models for code completion. GitHub Copilot Pro is designed for individual developers, freelancers, students, educators, and open source maintainers. The plan includes all the features of GitHub Copilot Business except organizational license management, policy management, and IP indemnity. How can I upgrade my GitHub Copilot Free license to Copilot Pro? If you're on the Free plan, you can upgrade to Pro through your Copilot settings page or directly on the Copilot marketing page . What is included in GitHub Copilot Free? GitHub Copilot Free users are limited to 2000 completions and 50 chat requests (including Copilot Edits). Which plan includes GitHub Copilot Autofix? GitHub Copilot Autofix provides contextual explanations and code suggestions to help developers fix vulnerabilities in code, and is included in GitHub Advanced Security and available to all public repositories. Privacy What personal data does GitHub Copilot process? GitHub Copilot processes personal data based on how Copilot is accessed and used: whether via GitHub.com, mobile app, extensions, or one of various IDE extensions, or through features like suggestions for the command line interface (CLI), IDE code completions, or personalized chat on GitHub.com. The types of personal data processed may include: User Engagement Data: This includes pseudonymous identifiers captured on user interactions with Copilot, such as accepted or dismissed completions, error messages, system logs, and product usage metrics. Prompts: These are inputs for chat or code, along with context, sent to Copilot's AI to generate suggestions. Suggestions: These are the AI-generated code lines or chat responses provided to users based on their prompts. Feedback Data: This comprises real-time user feedback, including reactions (e.g., thumbs up/down) and optional comments, along with feedback from support tickets. Does GitHub use Copilot Business or Enterprise data to train GitHub’s model? No. GitHub does not use either Copilot Business or Enterprise data to train its models. How does GitHub use the Copilot data? How GitHub uses Copilot data depends on how the user accesses Copilot and for what purpose. Users can access GitHub Copilot through the web, extensions, mobile apps, computer terminal, and various IDEs (Integrated Development Environments). GitHub generally uses personal data to: Deliver, maintain, and update the services as per the customer's configuration and usage, to ensure personalized experiences and recommendations Troubleshoot, which involves preventing, detecting, resolving, and mitigating issues, including security incidents and product-related problems, by fixing software bugs and maintaining the online services' functionality and up-to-dateness Enhance user productivity, reliability, effectiveness, quality, privacy, accessibility, and security by keeping the service current and operational These practices are outlined in GitHub’s Data Protection Agreement ( DPA) , which details our data handling commitments to our data controller customers. GitHub also uses certain personal data with customer authorization under the DPA, for the following purposes: Billing and account management To comply with and resolve legal obligations For abuse detection, prevention, and protection, virus scanning, and scanning to detect violations of terms of service To generate summary reports for calculating employee commissions and partner incentives To produce aggregated reports for internal use and strategic planning, covering areas like forecasting, revenue analysis, capacity planning, and product strategy, For details on GitHub's data processing activities as a controller, particularly for Copilot Pro customers, refer to the GitHub Privacy Statement . How long does GitHub retain Copilot data for Business and Enterprise customers? If and for how long GitHub’s retains Copilot data depends on how a Copilot user accesses Copilot and for what purpose. The default settings for Copilot Business and Enterprise Customers are as follows: Access through IDE for Chat and Code Completions: Prompts and Suggestions: Not retained User Engagement Data: Kept for two years. Feedback Data: Stored for as long as needed for its intended purpose. All other GitHub Copilot access and use: Prompts and Suggestions: Retained for 28 days. User Engagement Data: Kept for two years. Feedback Data: Stored for as long as needed for its intended purpose. Why do some Copilot features retain prompts and suggestions? Retaining prompts and suggestions is necessary for chat on github.com, mobile, and CLI Copilot because those features’ effectiveness depends on using thread history to improve responses. The Copilot model requires access to previous interactions to deliver accurate and relevant suggestions. Does GitHub Copilot support compliance with the GDPR and other data protection laws? Yes. GitHub and customers can enter a Data Protection Agreement that supports compliance with the GDPR and similar legislation. Does GitHub Copilot ever output personal data? While we've designed GitHub Copilot with privacy in mind, the expansive definition of personal data under legislation like the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) means we can't guarantee it will never output such data. The Large Language Model (LLM) powering GitHub Copilot was trained on public code and there were instances in our tests where the tool made suggestions resembling personal data. These suggestions were typically synthesized and not tied to real individuals. How does Copilot allow users to access, alter or delete personal data? These actions are available to Copilot users as described in the GitHub Privacy Statement . Responsible AI What are the intellectual property considerations when using GitHub Copilot? The primary IP considerations for GitHub Copilot relate to copyright. The model that powers Copilot is trained on a broad collection of publicly accessible code, which may include copyrighted code, and Copilot’s suggestions (in rare instances) may resemble the code its model was trained on. Here’s some basic information you should know about these considerations: Copyright law permits the use of copyrighted works to train AI models:  Countries around the world have provisions in their copyright laws that enable machines to learn, understand, extract patterns, and facts from copyrighted materials, including software code. For example, the European Union, Japan, and Singapore, have express provisions permitting machine learning to develop AI models. Other countries including Canada, India, and the United States also permit such training under their fair use/fair dealing provisions. GitHub Copilot’s AI model was trained with the use of code from GitHub’s public repositories—which are publicly accessible and within the scope of permissible copyright use. What about copyright risk in suggestions? In rare instances (less than 1% based on GitHub’s research), suggestions from GitHub may match examples of code used to train GitHub’s AI model. Again, Copilot does not “look up” or “copy and paste” code, but is instead using context from a user’s workspace to synthesize and generate a suggestion. Our experience shows that matching suggestions are most likely to occur in two situations: (i) when there is little or no context in the code editor for Copilot’s model to synthesize, or (ii) when a matching suggestion represents a common approach or method. If a code suggestion matches existing code, there is risk that using that suggestion could trigger claims of copyright infringement, which would depend on the amount and nature of code used, and the context of how the code is used. In many ways, this is the same risk that arises when using any code that a developer does not originate, such as copying code from an online source, or reusing code from a library. That is why responsible organizations and developers recommend that users employ code scanning policies to identify and evaluate potential matching code. In Copilot, you can opt whether to allow Copilot to suggest code completions that match publicly available code on GitHub.com. For more information, see " Configuring GitHub Copilot settings on GitHub.com ". If you have allowed suggestions that match public code, GitHub Copilot can provide you with details about the matching code when you accept such suggestions. Matching code does not necessarily mean copyright infringement, so it is ultimately up to the user to determine whether to use the suggestion, and what and who to attribute (along with other license compliance) in appropriate circumstances. Does GitHub Copilot include a filtering mechanism to mitigate risk? Yes, GitHub Copilot does include an optional code referencing filter to detect and suppress certain suggestions that match public code on GitHub. GitHub has created a duplication detection filter to detect and suppress suggestions that contain code segments over a certain length that match public code on GitHub. This filter can be enabled by the administrator for your enterprise and it can apply for all organizations within your enterprise, or the administrator can defer control to individual organizations. With the filter enabled, Copilot checks code suggestions for matches or near-matches against public code on GitHub of 65 lexemes or more (on average,150 characters). If there is a match, the suggestion will not be shown to the user. In addition to off-topic, harmful, and offensive output filters, GitHub Copilot also scans the outputs for vulnerable code. Does GitHub Copilot include features to make it easier for users to identify potentially relevant open source licenses for matching suggestions? Yes, GitHub Copilot is previewing a code referencing feature as an additional tool to assist users to find and review potentially relevant open source licenses. Code referencing is currently available in Visual Studio Code. This feature searches across public GitHub repositories for code that matches a Copilot suggestion. If there’s a match, users will find its information displayed in the Copilot console log, including where the match occurred, any applicable licenses, and a deep link to learn more. The deep link will take users to a navigable page on GitHub.com to browse examples of the code match and their repository licenses, and see how many repositories—including ones without licenses—that code appears in, as well as links to those repositories. Copilot users can review this information to determine whether the applicable suggestions are suitable for use, and whether additional measures may be necessary to use them. Who owns the suggestions provided by GitHub Copilot? We don’t determine whether a suggestion is capable of being owned, but we are clear that GitHub does not claim ownership of a suggestion. Whether a suggestion generated by an AI model can be owned depends on many factors (e.g. the intellectual property law in the relevant country, the length of the suggestion, the extent that suggestion is considered ‘functional’ instead of expressive, etc). If a suggestion is capable of being owned, our terms are clear: GitHub does not claim ownership. GitHub does not claim ownership of any suggestion. In certain cases, it is possible for Copilot to produce similar suggestions to different users. For example, two unrelated users both starting new files to code the quicksort algorithm in Java will likely get the same suggestion. The possibility of providing similar suggestions to multiple users is a common part of generative AI systems. Can GitHub Copilot introduce insecure code in its suggestions? Public code may contain insecure coding patterns, bugs, or references to outdated APIs or                        idioms. When GitHub Copilot synthesizes code suggestions based on this data, it can also                        synthesize code that contains these undesirable patterns. Copilot has filters in place that                        either block or notify users of insecure code patterns that are detected in Copilot suggestions. These filters target the most common vulnerable coding patterns, including hardcoded credentials , SQL injections , and path injections . Additionally, in recent years we’ve provided tools such as GitHub Advanced Security, GitHub Actions, Dependabot, and CodeQL to open source projects to help improve code quality. Of course, you should always use GitHub Copilot together with good testing and code review practices and security tools, as well as your own judgment. Is GitHub Copilot intended to fully automate code generation and replace developers? No. Copilot is a tool intended to make developers more efficient. It’s not intended to replace developers, who should continue to apply the same sorts of safeguards and diligence they would apply with regard to any third-party code of unknown origin. The product is called “Copilot” not “Autopilot” and it’s not intended to generate code without oversight. You should use exactly the same sorts of safeguards and diligence with Copilot’s suggestions as you would use with any third-party code. Identifying best practices for use of third party code is beyond the scope of this section. That said, whatever practices your organization currently uses – rigorous functionality testing, code scanning, security testing, etc. – you should continue these policies with Copilot’s suggestions. Moreover, you should make sure your code editor or editor does not automatically compile or run generated code before you review it. Can GitHub Copilot users simply use suggestions without concern? Not necessarily. GitHub Copilot users should align their use of Copilot with their respective                        risk tolerances. As noted above, GitHub Copilot is not intended to replace developers, or their individual skill and judgment, and is not intended to fully automate the process of code development. The same risks that apply to the use of any third-party code apply to the use of Copilot’s suggestions. Depending on your particular use case, you should consider implementing the protections discussed above. It is your responsibility to assess what is appropriate for the situation and implement appropriate safeguards. You’re entitled to IP indemnification from GitHub for the unmodified suggestions when Copilot’s filtering is enabled. If you do elect to enable this feature, the copyright responsibility is ours, not our customers. As part of our ongoing commitment to responsible AI, GitHub and Microsoft extends our IP indemnity and protection support to our customers who are empowering their teams with GitHub Copilot. See Microsoft's Copilot Copyright Commitment for more details. Does GitHub Copilot support accessibility features? We are conducting internal testing of GitHub Copilot’s ease of use by developers with                        disabilities and working to ensure that GitHub Copilot is accessible to all developers. Please feel free to share your feedback on GitHub Copilot accessibility in our feedback forum . Does GitHub Copilot produce offensive outputs? GitHub Copilot includes filters to block offensive language in the prompts and to avoid                        synthesizing suggestions in sensitive contexts. We continue to work on improving the filter                        system to more intelligently detect and remove offensive outputs. If you see offensive outputs, please report them directly to copilot-safety@github.com so that we can improve our safeguards. GitHub takes this challenge very seriously and we are committed to addressing it. Will GitHub Copilot work as well using languages other than English? Given public sources are predominantly in English, GitHub Copilot will likely work less well in scenarios where natural language prompts provided by the developer are not in English and/or are grammatically incorrect. Therefore, non-English speakers might experience a lower quality of service. What data has GitHub Copilot been trained on? GitHub Copilot is powered by generative AI models developed by GitHub, OpenAI, and Microsoft. It has been trained on natural language text and source code from publicly available sources, including code in public repositories on GitHub. Data from June 2023. Additional research can be found here . Feature in public beta for Copilot Pro and Business plans. Requires use of repositories, issues, discussions, Actions, and other features of GitHub. Authentication with SAML single sign-on (SSO) available for organizations using GitHub Enterprise Cloud. General Plans & Pricing Privacy Responsible AI General What is GitHub Copilot? GitHub Copilot transforms the developer experience. Backed by the leaders in AI, Copilot provides contextualized assistance throughout the software development lifecycle, from code completions and chat assistance in the IDE to code explanations and answers to docs in GitHub and more. With Copilot elevating their workflow, developers can focus on more: value, innovation, and happiness. GitHub Copilot enables developers to focus more energy on problem solving and collaboration and spend less effort on the mundane and boilerplate. That’s why developers who use Copilot report up to 75% higher satisfaction with their jobs than those who don’t and are up to 55% more productive at writing code without sacrifice to quality, which all adds up to engaged developers shipping great software faster. GitHub Copilot integrates with leading editors, including Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, JetBrains IDEs, and Neovim, and, unlike other AI coding assistants, is natively built into GitHub. Growing to millions of individual users and tens of thousands of business customers, Copilot is the world’s most widely adopted AI developer tool and the competitive advantage developers ask for by name. Who is eligible to access GitHub Copilot for free? GitHub Copilot Free is a new free pricing tier with limited functionality for individual developers. Users assigned a Copilot Business or Copilot Enterprise seat are not eligible for access. Users with access to Copilot Pro through a paid subscription, trial, or through an existing verified OSS, Student, Faculty, or MVP account may elect to use Free instead. What languages, IDEs, and platforms does GitHub Copilot support? GitHub Copilot is trained on all languages that appear in public repositories. For each language, the quality of suggestions you receive may depend on the volume and diversity of training data for that language. For example, JavaScript is well-represented in public repositories and is one of GitHub Copilot’s best supported languages. Languages with less representation in public repositories may produce fewer or less robust suggestions. GitHub Copilot is available as an extension in Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, Vim, Neovim, the JetBrains suite of IDEs, and Azure Data Studio. Although code completion functionality is available across all these extensions, chat functionality is currently available only in Visual Studio Code, JetBrains and Visual Studio. GitHub Copilot is also supported in terminals through GitHub CLI and as a chat integration in Windows Terminal Canary. With the GitHub Copilot Enterprise plan, GitHub Copilot is natively integrated into GitHub.com. All plans are supported in GitHub Copilot in GitHub Mobile. GitHub Mobile for Copilot Pro and Copilot Business have access to Bing and public repository code search. Copilot Enterprise in GitHub Mobile gives you additional access to your organization's knowledge. Does GitHub Copilot “copy/paste”? No, GitHub Copilot generates suggestions using probabilistic determination. When thinking about intellectual property and open source issues, it is critical to understand how GitHub Copilot really works. The AI models that create Copilot’s suggestions may be trained on public code, but do not contain any code. When they generate a suggestion, they are not “copying and pasting” from any codebase. To generate a code suggestion, the Copilot extension begins by examining the code in your editor—focusing on the lines just before and after your cursor, but also information including other files open in your editor and the URLs of repositories or file paths to identify relevant context. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions. To generate a suggestion for chat in the code editor, the Copilot extension creates a contextual prompt by combining your prompt with additional context including the code file open in your active document, your code selection, and general workspace information, such as frameworks, languages, and dependencies. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions. To generate a suggestion for chat on GitHub.com, such as providing an answer to a question from your chat prompt, Copilot creates a contextual prompt by combining your prompt with additional context including previous prompts, the open pages on GitHub.com as well as retrieved context from your codebase or Bing search. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.

Privacy What personal data does GitHub Copilot process? GitHub Copilot processes personal data based on how Copilot is accessed and used: whether via GitHub.com, mobile app, extensions, or one of various IDE extensions, or through features like suggestions for the command line interface (CLI), IDE code completions, or personalized chat on GitHub.com. The types of personal data processed may include: User Engagement Data: This includes pseudonymous identifiers captured on user interactions with Copilot, such as accepted or dismissed completions, error messages, system logs, and product usage metrics. Prompts: These are inputs for chat or code, along with context, sent to Copilot's AI to generate suggestions. Suggestions: These are the AI-generated code lines or chat responses provided to users based on their prompts. Feedback Data: This comprises real-time user feedback, including reactions (e.g., thumbs up/down) and optional comments, along with feedback from support tickets. Does GitHub use Copilot Business or Enterprise data to train GitHub’s model? No. GitHub does not use either Copilot Business or Enterprise data to train its models. How does GitHub use the Copilot data? How GitHub uses Copilot data depends on how the user accesses Copilot and for what purpose. Users can access GitHub Copilot through the web, extensions, mobile apps, computer terminal, and various IDEs (Integrated Development Environments). GitHub generally uses personal data to: Deliver, maintain, and update the services as per the customer's configuration and usage, to ensure personalized experiences and recommendations Troubleshoot, which involves preventing, detecting, resolving, and mitigating issues, including security incidents and product-related problems, by fixing software bugs and maintaining the online services' functionality and up-to-dateness Enhance user productivity, reliability, effectiveness, quality, privacy, accessibility, and security by keeping the service current and operational These practices are outlined in GitHub’s Data Protection Agreement ( DPA) , which details our data handling commitments to our data controller customers. GitHub also uses certain personal data with customer authorization under the DPA, for the following purposes: Billing and account management To comply with and resolve legal obligations For abuse detection, prevention, and protection, virus scanning, and scanning to detect violations of terms of service To generate summary reports for calculating employee commissions and partner incentives To produce aggregated reports for internal use and strategic planning, covering areas like forecasting, revenue analysis, capacity planning, and product strategy, For details on GitHub's data processing activities as a controller, particularly for Copilot Pro customers, refer to the GitHub Privacy Statement . How long does GitHub retain Copilot data for Business and Enterprise customers? If and for how long GitHub’s retains Copilot data depends on how a Copilot user accesses Copilot and for what purpose. The default settings for Copilot Business and Enterprise Customers are as follows: Access through IDE for Chat and Code Completions: Prompts and Suggestions: Not retained User Engagement Data: Kept for two years. Feedback Data: Stored for as long as needed for its intended purpose. All other GitHub Copilot access and use: Prompts and Suggestions: Retained for 28 days. User Engagement Data: Kept for two years. Feedback Data: Stored for as long as needed for its intended purpose. Why do some Copilot features retain prompts and suggestions? Retaining prompts and suggestions is necessary for chat on github.com, mobile, and CLI Copilot because those features’ effectiveness depends on using thread history to improve responses. The Copilot model requires access to previous interactions to deliver accurate and relevant suggestions. Does GitHub Copilot support compliance with the GDPR and other data protection laws? Yes. GitHub and customers can enter a Data Protection Agreement that supports compliance with the GDPR and similar legislation. Does GitHub Copilot ever output personal data? While we've designed GitHub Copilot with privacy in mind, the expansive definition of personal data under legislation like the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) means we can't guarantee it will never output such data. The Large Language Model (LLM) powering GitHub Copilot was trained on public code and there were instances in our tests where the tool made suggestions resembling personal data. These suggestions were typically synthesized and not tied to real individuals. How does Copilot allow users to access, alter or delete personal data? These actions are available to Copilot users as described in the GitHub Privacy Statement . Responsible AI What are the intellectual property considerations when using GitHub Copilot? The primary IP considerations for GitHub Copilot relate to copyright. The model that powers Copilot is trained on a broad collection of publicly accessible code, which may include copyrighted code, and Copilot’s suggestions (in rare instances) may resemble the code its model was trained on. Here’s some basic information you should know about these considerations: Copyright law permits the use of copyrighted works to train AI models:  Countries around the world have provisions in their copyright laws that enable machines to learn, understand, extract patterns, and facts from copyrighted materials, including software code. For example, the European Union, Japan, and Singapore, have express provisions permitting machine learning to develop AI models. Other countries including Canada, India, and the United States also permit such training under their fair use/fair dealing provisions. GitHub Copilot’s AI model was trained with the use of code from GitHub’s public repositories—which are publicly accessible and within the scope of permissible copyright use. What about copyright risk in suggestions? In rare instances (less than 1% based on GitHub’s research), suggestions from GitHub may match examples of code used to train GitHub’s AI model. Again, Copilot does not “look up” or “copy and paste” code, but is instead using context from a user’s workspace to synthesize and generate a suggestion.

In Copilot, you can opt whether to allow Copilot to suggest code completions that match publicly available code on GitHub.com. For more information, see " Configuring GitHub Copilot settings on GitHub.com ". If you have allowed suggestions that match public code, GitHub Copilot can provide you with details about the matching code when you accept such suggestions. Matching code does not necessarily mean copyright infringement, so it is ultimately up to the user to determine whether to use the suggestion, and what and who to attribute (along with other license compliance) in appropriate circumstances. Does GitHub Copilot include a filtering mechanism to mitigate risk? Yes, GitHub Copilot does include an optional code referencing filter to detect and suppress certain suggestions that match public code on GitHub. GitHub has created a duplication detection filter to detect and suppress suggestions that contain code segments over a certain length that match public code on GitHub. This filter can be enabled by the administrator for your enterprise and it can apply for all organizations within your enterprise, or the administrator can defer control to individual organizations. With the filter enabled, Copilot checks code suggestions for matches or near-matches against public code on GitHub of 65 lexemes or more (on average,150 characters). If there is a match, the suggestion will not be shown to the user. In addition to off-topic, harmful, and offensive output filters, GitHub Copilot also scans the outputs for vulnerable code. Does GitHub Copilot include features to make it easier for users to identify potentially relevant open source licenses for matching suggestions? Yes, GitHub Copilot is previewing a code referencing feature as an additional tool to assist users to find and review potentially relevant open source licenses. Code referencing is currently available in Visual Studio Code. This feature searches across public GitHub repositories for code that matches a Copilot suggestion. If there’s a match, users will find its information displayed in the Copilot console log, including where the match occurred, any applicable licenses, and a deep link to learn more. The deep link will take users to a navigable page on GitHub.com to browse examples of the code match and their repository licenses, and see how many repositories—including ones without licenses—that code appears in, as well as links to those repositories. Copilot users can review this information to determine whether the applicable suggestions are suitable for use, and whether additional measures may be necessary to use them. Who owns the suggestions provided by GitHub Copilot? We don’t determine whether a suggestion is capable of being owned, but we are clear that GitHub does not claim ownership of a suggestion. Whether a suggestion generated by an AI model can be owned depends on many factors (e.g. the intellectual property law in the relevant country, the length of the suggestion, the extent that suggestion is considered ‘functional’ instead of expressive, etc). If a suggestion is capable of being owned, our terms are clear: GitHub does not claim ownership. GitHub does not claim ownership of any suggestion. In certain cases, it is possible for Copilot to produce similar suggestions to different users. For example, two unrelated users both starting new files to code the quicksort algorithm in Java will likely get the same suggestion. The possibility of providing similar suggestions to multiple users is a common part of generative AI systems. Can GitHub Copilot introduce insecure code in its suggestions? Public code may contain insecure coding patterns, bugs, or references to outdated APIs or                        idioms. When GitHub Copilot synthesizes code suggestions based on this data, it can also                        synthesize code that contains these undesirable patterns. Copilot has filters in place that                        either block or notify users of insecure code patterns that are detected in Copilot suggestions. These filters target the most common vulnerable coding patterns, including hardcoded credentials , SQL injections , and path injections . Additionally, in recent years we’ve provided tools such as GitHub Advanced Security, GitHub Actions, Dependabot, and CodeQL to open source projects to help improve code quality. Of course, you should always use GitHub Copilot together with good testing and code review practices and security tools, as well as your own judgment. Is GitHub Copilot intended to fully automate code generation and replace developers? No. Copilot is a tool intended to make developers more efficient. It’s not intended to replace developers, who should continue to apply the same sorts of safeguards and diligence they would apply with regard to any third-party code of unknown origin. The product is called “Copilot” not “Autopilot” and it’s not intended to generate code without oversight.

Not necessarily. GitHub Copilot users should align their use of Copilot with their respective                        risk tolerances. As noted above, GitHub Copilot is not intended to replace developers, or their individual skill and judgment, and is not intended to fully automate the process of code development. The same risks that apply to the use of any third-party code apply to the use of Copilot’s suggestions. Depending on your particular use case, you should consider implementing the protections discussed above. It is your responsibility to assess what is appropriate for the situation and implement appropriate safeguards. You’re entitled to IP indemnification from GitHub for the unmodified suggestions when Copilot’s filtering is enabled. If you do elect to enable this feature, the copyright responsibility is ours, not our customers. As part of our ongoing commitment to responsible AI, GitHub and Microsoft extends our IP indemnity and protection support to our customers who are empowering their teams with GitHub Copilot. See Microsoft's Copilot Copyright Commitment for more details. Does GitHub Copilot support accessibility features? We are conducting internal testing of GitHub Copilot’s ease of use by developers with                        disabilities and working to ensure that GitHub Copilot is accessible to all developers. Please feel free to share your feedback on GitHub Copilot accessibility in our feedback forum . Does GitHub Copilot produce offensive outputs? GitHub Copilot includes filters to block offensive language in the prompts and to avoid                        synthesizing suggestions in sensitive contexts. We continue to work on improving the filter                        system to more intelligently detect and remove offensive outputs. If you see offensive outputs, please report them directly to copilot-safety@github.com so that we can improve our safeguards. GitHub takes this challenge very seriously and we are committed to addressing it. Will GitHub Copilot work as well using languages other than English? Given public sources are predominantly in English, GitHub Copilot will likely work less well in scenarios where natural language prompts provided by the developer are not in English and/or are grammatically incorrect. Therefore, non-English speakers might experience a lower quality of service. What data has GitHub Copilot been trained on? GitHub Copilot is powered by generative AI models developed by GitHub, OpenAI, and Microsoft. It has been trained on natural language text and source code from publicly available sources, including code in public repositories on GitHub. Data from June 2023. Additional research can be found here . Feature in public beta for Copilot Pro and Business plans. Requires use of repositories, issues, discussions, Actions, and other features of GitHub.

Understanding GitHub Code Search syntax - GitHub Docs Skip to main content GitHub Docs Version: Free, Pro, & Team Search GitHub Docs Search Select language: current language is English Open Search Bar Close Search Bar Open Menu Open Sidebar Search on GitHub / GitHub Code Search / Code search syntax Home Search on GitHub Start with search on GitHub About searching on GitHub Understand search syntax Troubleshoot search queries Sorting search results Searching on GitHub Finding files on GitHub Search for repositories Searching topics Searching code (legacy) Searching commits Search issues & PRs Searching discussions Search GitHub Marketplace Search GitHub Models Searching users Searching for packages Searching wikis Searching in forks Searching gists GitHub Code Search About GitHub Code Search Using GitHub Code Search Code search syntax Search on GitHub / GitHub Code Search / Code search syntax Understanding GitHub Code Search syntax You can build search queries for the results you want with specialized code qualifiers, regular expressions, and boolean operations. In this article About code search query structure Query for an exact match Searching for quotes and backslashes Using boolean operations Using qualifiers Using regular expressions Separating search terms Case sensitivity About code search query structure The search syntax in this article only applies to searching code with GitHub code search. Note that the syntax and qualifiers for searching for non-code content, such as issues, users, and discussions, is not the same as the syntax for code search. For more information on non-code search, see About searching on GitHub and Searching on GitHub . Search queries consist of search terms, comprising text you want to search for, and qualifiers, which narrow down the search. A bare term with no qualifiers will match either the content of a file or the file's path. For example, the following query: http-push The above query will match the file docs/http-push.txt , even if it doesn't contain the term http-push . It will also match a file called example.txt if it contains the term http-push . You can enter multiple terms separated by whitespace to search for documents that satisfy both terms. For example, the following query: sparse index The search results would include all documents containing both the terms sparse and index , in any order. As examples, it would match a file containing SparseIndexVector , a file with the phrase index for sparse trees , and even a file named index.txt that contains the term sparse . Searching for multiple terms separated by whitespace is the equivalent to the search hello AND world . Other boolean operations, such as hello OR world , are also supported. For more information about boolean operations, see Using boolean operations . Code search also supports searching for an exact string, including whitespace. For more information, see Query for an exact match . You can narrow your code search with specialized qualifiers, such as repo: , language: and path: . For more information on the qualifiers you can use in code search, see Using qualifiers . You can also use regular expressions in your searches by surrounding the expression in slashes. For more information on using regular expressions, see Using regular expressions . Query for an exact match To search for an exact string, including whitespace, you can surround the string in quotes. For example: "sparse index" You can also use quoted strings in qualifiers, for example: path:git language:"protocol buffers" Searching for quotes and backslashes To search for code containing a quotation mark, you can escape the quotation mark using a backslash. For example, to find the exact string name = "tensorflow" , you can search: "name = \"tensorflow\"" To search for code containing a backslash, \ , use a double backslash, \\ . The two escape sequences \\ and \" can be used outside of quotes as well. No other escape sequences are recognized, though. A backslash that isn't followed by either " or \ is included in the search, unchanged. Additional escape sequences, such as \n to match a newline character, are supported in regular expressions. See Using regular expressions . Using boolean operations Code search supports boolean expressions. You can use the operators AND , OR , and NOT to combine search terms. By default, adjacent terms separated by whitespace are equivalent to using the AND operator. For example, the search query sparse index is the same as sparse AND index , meaning that the search results will include all documents containing both the terms sparse and index , in any order. To search for documents containing either one term or the other, you can use the OR operator. For example, the following query will match documents containing either sparse or index : sparse OR index To exclude files from your search results, you can use the NOT operator. For example, to exclude files in the __testing__ directory, you can search: "fatal error" NOT path:__testing__ You can use parentheses to express more complicated boolean expressions. For example: (language:ruby OR language:python) AND NOT path:"/tests/" Using qualifiers You can use specialized keywords to qualify your search. Repository qualifier Organization and user qualifiers Language qualifier Path qualifier Symbol qualifier Content qualifier Is qualifier Repository qualifier To search within a repository, use the repo: qualifier. You must provide the full repository name, including the owner. For example: repo:github-linguist/linguist To search within a set of repositories, you can combine multiple repo: qualifiers with the boolean operator OR . For example: repo:github-linguist/linguist OR repo:tree-sitter/tree-sitter Note Code search does not currently support regular expressions or partial matching for repository names, so you will have to type the entire repository name (including the user prefix) for the repo: qualifier to work. Organization and user qualifiers To search for files within an organization, use the org: qualifier. For example: org:github To search for files within a personal account, use the user: qualifier. For example: user:octocat Note Code search does not currently support regular expressions or partial matching for organization or user names, so you will have to type the entire organization or user name for the qualifier to work. Language qualifier To narrow down to a specific languages, use the language: qualifier. For example: language:ruby OR language:cpp OR language:csharp For a complete list of supported language names, see languages.yaml in github-linguist/linguist . If your preferred language is not on the list, you can open a pull request to add it. Path qualifier To search within file paths, use the path: qualifier. This will match files containing the term anywhere in their file path. For example, to find files containing the term unit_tests in their path, use: path:unit_tests The above query will match both src/unit_tests/my_test.py and src/docs/unit_tests.md since they both contain unit_test somewhere in their path. To match only a specific filename (and not part of the path), you could use a regular expression: path:/(^|\/)README\.md$/ Note that the . in the filename is escaped, since . has special meaning for regular expressions. For more information about using regular expressions, see Using regular expressions . You can also use some limited glob expressions in the path: qualifier. For example, to search for files with the extension txt , you can use: path:*.txt To search for JavaScript files within a `src` directory, you could use: path:src/*.js By default, glob expressions are not anchored to the start of the path, so the above expression would still match a path like app/src/main.js . But if you prefix the expression with / , it will anchor to the start. For example: path:/src/*.js Note that * doesn't match the / character, so for the above example, all results will be direct descendants of the src directory. To match within subdirectories, so that results include deeply nested files such as /src/app/testing/utils/example.js , you can use ** . For example: path:/src/**/*.js You can also use the ? global character. For example, to match the path file.aac or file.abc , you can use: path:*.a?c To search for a filename which contains a special character like `*` or `?`, just use a quoted string: path:"file?" Glob expressions are disabled for quoted strings, so the above query will only match paths containing the literal string file? . Symbol qualifier You can search for symbol definitions in code, such as function or class definitions, using the symbol: qualifier. Symbol search is based on parsing your code using the open source Tree-sitter parser ecosystem, so no extra setup or build tool integration is required. For example, to search for a symbol called WithContext : language:go symbol:WithContext In some languages, you can search for symbols using a prefix (e.g. a prefix of their class name). For example, for a method deleteRows on a struct Maint , you could search symbol:Maint.deleteRows if you are using Go, or symbol:Maint::deleteRows in Rust. You can also use regular expressions with the symbol qualifier. For example, the following query would find conversions people have implemented in Rust for the String type: language:rust symbol:/^String::to_.*/ Note that this qualifier only searches for definitions and not references, and not all symbol types or languages are fully supported yet. Symbol extraction is supported for the following languages: Bash C C# C++ CodeQL Elixir Go JSX Java JavaScript Lua PHP Protocol Buffers Python R Ruby Rust Scala Starlark Swift Typescript We are working on adding support for more languages. If you would like to help contribute to this effort, you can add support for your language in the open source Tree-sitter parser ecosystem, upon which symbol search is based. Content qualifier By default, bare terms search both paths and file content. To restrict a search to strictly match the content of a file and not file paths, use the content: qualifier. For example: content:README.md This query would only match files containing the term README.md , rather than matching files named README.md . Is qualifier To filter based on repository properties, you can use the is: qualifier. is: supports the following values: archived : restricts the search to archived repositories. fork : restricts the search to forked repositories. vendored : restricts the search to content detected as vendored. generated : restricts the search to content detected as generated. For example: path:/^MIT.txt$/ is:archived Note that the is: qualifier can be inverted with the NOT operator. To search for non-archived repositories, you can search: log4j NOT is:archived To exclude forks from your results, you can search: log4j NOT is:fork Using regular expressions Code search supports regular expressions to search for patterns in your code. You can use regular expressions in bare search terms as well as within many qualifiers, by surrounding the regex in slashes. For example, to search for the regular expression sparse.*index , you would use: /sparse.*index/ Note that you'll have to escape any forward slashes within the regular expression. For example, to search for files within the App/src directory, you would use: /^App\/src\// Inside a regular expression, \n stands for a newline character, \t stands for a tab, and \x{hhhh} can be used to escape any Unicode character. This means you can use regular expressions to search for exact strings that contain characters that you can't type into the search bar. Most common regular expressions features work in code search. However, "look-around" assertions are not supported. Separating search terms All parts of a search, such as search terms, exact strings, regular expressions, qualifiers, parentheses, and the boolean keywords AND , OR , and NOT , must be separated from one another with spaces. The one exception is that items inside parentheses, ( ) , don't need to be separated from the parentheses. If your search contains multiple components that aren't separated by spaces, or other text that does not follow the rules listed above, code search will try to guess what you mean. It often falls back on treating that component of your query as the exact text to search for. For example, the following query: printf("hello world\n"); Code search will give up on interpreting the parentheses and quotes as special characters and will instead search for files containing that exact code. If code search guesses wrong, you can always get the search you wanted by using quotes and spaces to make the meaning clear. Case sensitivity By default, code search is case-insensitive, and results will include both uppercase and lowercase results. You can do case-sensitive searches by using a regular expression with case insensitivity turned off. For example, to search for the string "True", you would use: /(?-i)True/ Help and support Did you find what you needed? Yes No Privacy policy Help us make these docs great!

In addition, AI is used to find elusive secrets like passwords, and generate custom patterns so secret scanning can identify sensitive data like personally identifying information (PII) based on natural-language examples. What languages does Copilot Autofix support? Copilot Autofix can generate explanations and code suggestions for all languages supported by the CodeQL code scanning engine, including C++, C#, Go, Java, JavaScript/Typescript, Kotlin, Ruby, and Swift. Do I need to purchase a GitHub Copilot license? No. Copilot Autofix is exclusive to and included with GitHub Advanced Security. A Copilot license is not required . Deployment Can I review documentation before purchase? Yes. As with all GitHub products, documentation for GitHub Advanced Security is publicly available. Does GitHub offer consulting, training, and other deployment services? Yes! Please visit Expert Services to learn more. More Security Resources What security features are free to use for public repositories? As part of our mission to support the open source community and keep open source software safe and reliable for all, GitHub provides security features like code scanning, secret scanning, and supply chain security tools at no charge for use with public repositories. What is the GitHub Security Lab? The GitHub Security Lab is a team of security experts who cultivate a collaborative community where developers and security professionals come together to help secure open source software. Our mission: make open source software secure and reliable for the benefit of developers everywhere through collaboration and contributions from maintainers, developers, and security researchers around the world. What is the Advisory Database, and how is it different from a CVE? Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) is a database of publicly disclosed information about security issues, with a unique number to identify each vulnerability. But while CVEs document vulnerabilities, they don’t tell the whole story. Unlike a CVE, entries in the GitHub Advisory Database contain additional context and remediation guidance – sourced from a global community of security experts and curated by the GitHub Security Lab – to help developers and security teams understand vulnerabilities, assess risk, and fix with confidence. How can I manage and secure open source dependencies? GitHub provides extensive supply chain security tools and resources to help developers and maintainers keep open source software up-to-date and secure, including Dependabot. If you’re new to software supply chain security, the Dependabot quickstart guide is a great place to begin. Where can I learn more about the security of the GitHub platform? Visit the GitHub Trust Center to learn more about security, privacy, compliance, and transparency. Footnotes Overall, the median time for developers to use Copilot Autofix to automatically commit the fix for a PR-time alert was 28 minutes, compared to 1.5 hours to resolve the same alerts manually (3x faster). For SQL injection vulnerabilities: 18 minutes compared to 3.7 hours (12x faster). Based on new code scanning alerts found by CodeQL in pull requests (PRs) on repositories with GitHub Advanced Security enabled. These are examples; your results will vary.
