Know what content is shared
Share any file or folder easily, with anyone
File sharing with Dropbox is quick and simple. By just sharing a link, you can send anything—from photos and videos to zipped folders and large CAD files—to anyone, even if they don’t have a Dropbox account.
Easily share links and files from anywhere, using your phone, tablet or computer. And unlike email attachments, you don’t have to worry about file size limits—share files as large as your cloud storage space quota, starting at 2 GB and up.
Share links to files
Get real-time updates on changes to shared files
No more manual checking—find out exactly when someone has made changes to a file you’ve shared.
With cloud file-sharing services from Dropbox, you’ll immediately see who’s added, edited, deleted, renamed, or moved an online file. Any changes made to a shared file will be automatically updated and synced for all recipients.
Shared file synchronization and activity notifications come as standard, with any Dropbox plan.
Find the right plan for you
Organize shared folders
Dropbox cloud storage is a great place to help teams get organized and add files to one central location. It’s easy for team members to see where everything is, and which files are the most recent—and in need of immediate attention.
Shared folders: Working on a file-heavy project with several team members? Shared folders give everyone rich workspaces where they can get coordinated by uploading content, sharing files, adding folder descriptions, and assigning to-dos. And any edits you make within the folder will be immediately synced to other members, for quick and easy collaboration in real-time.
Groups: With Dropbox, you can easily upload files and share materials with relevant parties by creating a group, adding a list of members, and inviting the group to shared folders.
Learn how to organize folders
Control what you share
Collaborative file sharing just got easier. 
Manage folder permissions: Ensure secure folder sharing with multiple folder permissions. Choose if you want to give recipients editing or view-only access to your folder and manage your sharing options.
Sharing options and controls: Sending a file as an email attachment can put your data’s security at risk. With Dropbox, you can easily share a link to a file or folder that is limited to view-only access. Plus, you can add password protection to a shared link, set a link expiration date and disable downloads.
Granular folder permissions: Share a specific subfolder without giving access to the entire folder it lives within. Give your vendors access to just one “Final Images” subfolder, for example, located inside your larger “Graphic Design” folder.
Try it for yourself
"Dropbox is how we share photos, written content, portfolio features, media features, product photos, newsletter mockups, and the content calendar. It's great to have everything organized in one place for them."
Cecilia Roy
Owner, Snowdrop Creative

Send long videos to anyone—from just about anywhere
Dropbox makes it easy to send long video files. Share recordings, collaborate on projects, or simply send footage hassle free.
If you’re wondering how to share a video clip or a series of clips, Dropbox can do it quickly and securely.
Get started
Sharing long videos is easy with Dropbox
Never again worry about how to send long videos, too large videos, or any uncompressed video files. Within your Dropbox account, you can easily create a link or use Dropbox Transfer to send files up to 100 GB (or 250 GB with the Creative Tools Add-On) without taking up your storage space. 
It’s the best way to share all of your long videos and large files with friends, colleagues, or clients. Your recipients can view and download the videos you send—even if they don’t have an account.
Try Dropbox Transfer for free
Upload and watch long videos online—without downloading
Watch long videos instantaneously with Dropbox—even if your internet connection isn’t great. 
All it takes is a quick adjustment to your quality settings and you can continue watching without interruption. It’s perfect for smooth collaboration, training, and working with teams.
And when you share a link to a long video file, your recipient can stream the video online right then and there—there’s no need for downloading.
Find out about sharing links
Stay in control after you send long videos, short videos, and other files
With Dropbox, you always run the show. When you transfer a file by sharing a link from your Dropbox account, recipients can view, comment on, or download the file—but they will be unable to edit the original. You can easily control access however you like.
Collaborating on a video project and want others to be able to edit your videos? Just invite them to a shared folder with the files inside. Don’t want prying eyes peeking at your stuff? Simply add a password or set a date for the link to expire—so only those with access can watch your videos.
Help on link expiration
Collaborate easily—even on long videos and other big files
Making a documentary or co-creating something big? As part of our Creative Tools Add-On, frame-accurate commenting, like time-based comments, helps to streamline creative reviews.
Avoid endless email threads, and enable others to jump to the exact frame you're referring to—or tag team members, clients, and vendors to notify them of your comments and keep projects moving.

“Per project, Dropbox Replay easily saves me a day of work over the course of a month. It saves a ton of time.”
Nicholas Gartner
Film Editor, A Thousand Cuts
“We use Replay for our content that requires lots of feedback and iterations, like campaigns with our players and commercial marketing materials. With Replay, we can share our feedback in one place, keep all the conversations documented in the comment threads, and have everything we need for edits and final delivery.”
Rachel Jedwood
Production Officer, National Rugby League
“I'll really miss emails with bulleted lists of video edits – said no one ever! Consolidated, frame-accurate edit notes make revisions and approvals a breeze.”
Sam Sullivan
Owner & Graphic Designer, Notion Design Goods
“Replay makes what I do easier and simpler. I can get feedback from everybody in one spot—and check off comments as resolved—without email threads going around and context getting lost.”
Daniel Jackson
Founder & Owner, Embassy: Interactive
“Dropbox Replay works well with the rest of my workflow. Since my work-in-progress files are already in Dropbox, I can just click on the file and add it to Replay.”
Scott Lalonde
Filmmaker, scottlalonde.com
“Now with Replay, we can keep feedback centralized and the number of files I need to process to a minimum. Replay's integration with Adobe Premiere Pro will also make it easy for our post-production team to implement changes. I'm a huge fan.”
Adam Nielson
Creative Director of Branded Experience, Kaleidoscope Pictures
“Dropbox Replay is a good selling tool for clients, and the tracking tools are super helpful. It looks super cool when clients get a Dropbox Replay link. It’s a professional way to send videos to my clients.”
Alan Novey
Owner, BIGCAT Media
“I manage a distributed team that produces hundreds of videos a year. It’s very time consuming to keep track of changes. But with Replay, we can watch the videos with our clients, capturing comments and tracking revisions in real-time. It’s an amazing tool for my team.”

Create and safely store account login details
Say goodbye to the days of storing passwords in dusty old notebooks, or on sticky notes scattered across your desk. Your accounts and data deserve a modern security solution.
With Dropbox Passwords as your password manager, it’s easy to create and store unique passwords as you sign up for new online accounts. In the event of a data breach, we’ll notify you—enabling you to quickly update or reset passwords.
Available with any Dropbox plan
Instantly log in to any website or app with autofill
Dropbox Passwords autofills your usernames and passwords for instant access to your favorite websites and apps. With apps available for Windows, Mac, iOS, and Android, you can automatically log in from anywhere.
Add the free browser extension to get started
Why use a password manager?
Create stronger passwords
Passwords containing common words and dates can be cracked in seconds by experienced hackers. Automatically generate complex, strong passwords that are practically-impossible for hackers to break through with current technology.
Make your passwords unique
Using the same password for everything might make things easier to remember, but it also makes things easy for hackers in the event of a breach. A password manager enables you to use different passwords for each account, without needing to remember them all.
Avoid a physical paper trail
Physical copies of passwords, like hand-written notes, pose a major security risk if they were to fall into the wrong hands. By using a password manager, you no longer need to write passwords down and can avoid exposing yourself to threats.
Secure password management made easy
Protect your passwords and safeguard your account details with a secure, easy-to-use app—built by a trusted leader in cloud solutions.
Password breach monitoring—keeps you alerted when your information is at risk.
Zero-knowledge encryption—ensures that your passwords are only accessible to you.

Our mission is to design a more enlightened way of working
Our story
Back in 2007, making work better for people meant designing a simpler way to keep files in sync. Today, it means designing products that reduce busywork so you can focus on the work that matters.
  Most “productivity tools” get in your way. They constantly ping, distract, and disrupt your team’s flow, so you spend your days switching between apps and tracking down feedback. It’s busywork, not the meaningful stuff. We want to change this. 
  We believe there’s a more enlightened way to work. Dropbox helps people be organized, stay focused, and get in sync with their teams. Learn more.

Know what content is shared
Back up photos automatically
Whether they’re memories from family vacations or digital assets for work projects, your online photos are some of your most important files. Backing up full-resolution copies to cloud storage can give you peace of mind. Dropbox can keep your photos safe in several ways:
Camera uploads — Photos from your phone or tablet will be automatically backed up to Dropbox. Or in our desktop app, photos will be copied from cameras, memory cards, or mobile devices whenever you connect one to your computer.
Screenshot backups — Set up our desktop app to automatically move screenshot images to your Dropbox account, or back up mobile device screenshots using camera uploads.
Document scanning — The Dropbox mobile app lets you use your phone’s camera to scan and make digital backups of receipts, whiteboards, and paper documents.
Try the Dropbox mobile app
Organize and browse photos
Dropbox makes it easy to get to your image and video files once they’re backed up.
Windows and Mac sync — In the Dropbox desktop app, you’ll find all your photos in folders you can access from Windows File Explorer and macOS Finder. Organize them into subfolders or edit them in your favorite software, just like any other file. Your changes will update on other devices connected to your Dropbox account.
Photo browsing — View and browse all of your photos and videos from the Photos tab in our mobile app or on the web. 
Image previews — View over 35 image file types from dropbox.com or our mobile app. Preview common files like JPEG, PNG, and GIF; app-specific types like Photoshop and Illustrator; raw formats like CR2, DCR, and DNG; and even iOS HEIC photos. Best of all, there’s no need for special photo software.
Image tagging — Add searchable hashtags to individual photos or an entire folder to find files fast.
Organize files and folders
Share and distribute photos
Sending pics of the kids to the grandparents? Transferring image assets to clients or customers? Dropbox makes it simple and secure.
Shared links — Easily create a link to share any file or folder in your Dropbox. Copy and paste links into emails, text messages, or chats to share with anyone—even if they don’t have a Dropbox account.
Access control — Keep your photos in the right hands. Add password protection, expiration dates, and sign-in requirements to your shared links.
Shared folders  — Want to collect your photos and someone else’s in the same place? Share files by inviting others to sync a folder between your account and theirs.
Share links securely
Get space to store photos
No matter how many images you need to keep safe in the cloud, Dropbox can help you store them all.
Storage options — Start with 2 GB of free storage. When you need more, paid plans offer 2 or 3 TB for your photos, videos and other files. Subscriptions for teams start with 5 TB or more.
Save hard drive space — Mark photo and video files and folders you don’t need straight away as online-only. They’ll still show up in Windows File Explorer and macOS Finder, but will only take up a small amount of space until you need them.

“We look for simple, flexible tools that do the job well. Dropbox was the obvious choice for us in that regard. So many of our employees were already using the product before we rolled it out that we did not need to invest in much additional training.”
— Richard Wetzel
Partner, Centric Projects
“The flexibility offered by Dropbox's approach to security has made it much easier to manage than our file server ever was. By sharing the responsibility for setting permissions with our project managers we are able to reduce the burden on IT and optimize sharing for end user needs.”
— Alex Serriere
CTO, TEECOM
“Dropbox not only delivers on its promise of reliable mobile access to our files but, through the integration with Office, makes it dead simple for our users to edit those files and save them back to Dropbox no matter where they are or what device they’re using.”
— Kendall Pouland
Director of Tech & Innovation, Tellepsen
“For a long time, we relied on paper photocopies, pen and pencil mark-ups, scanning and emailing documents to submit bids. Now, we organize, edit and assemble all submittal packets right in Dropbox, then share those packets externally with engineers using shared links. That change alone has freed up over 500 hours of project manager time.”
— Joe Hersom
Project Manager, EJ Prescott

“With Dropbox, educators can collaborate securely with colleagues on any device and platform — across campus and across the world.”
Tina Thorstenson

“We’re receiving tons of pictures and are constantly overriding things that couldn’t be managed in email. Dropbox saves us a huge amount of miscommunication by allowing the latest versions of documents to be available to everybody at all times.”
Andrew Hall

Elias Eldayrie
Vice President & CIO
“We’ve always been a pioneer in the card industry, and we think of ourselves in the same way in the digital space. Thankfully, we pretty much have three words internally that keep us creating great work: ‘It’s on Dropbox.”
Chris R. Vaccaro
Director, Live Operations & Editor-in-Chief, Mobile
“We’ve always had a global presence, but before Dropbox, we couldn’t be as spread out as we are now. Dropbox makes our employees feel like they’re all in the same office.”
Daniel Jiménez

Access your files from multiple devices
Dropbox offers one central hub for online file storage, file sharing, and syncing. Whether you’re at work or on the road, your files are synced across your devices and accessible in real time. Access your Dropbox account with desktop apps on Windows and Mac, our mobile app for iOS or Android devices, and on the web through your browser.

Protect your data
If your device is lost or stolen, rest easy knowing your data’s safe. Remote wipe lets you clear all the files and folders from your missing device’s Dropbox account. All of your files are securely saved in cloud storage and easily retrievable.

Recover your files
Accidentally delete a file or save a new version of a file you’re not happy with? No problem. Dropbox stores copies of all deleted files and folders for 30 days—or as many as 180 days for Dropbox Standard, Advanced, and Enterprise plans. This includes previous versions of files, so you can easily recover them.
We also provide confirmation warnings on the desktop when team members move or delete files. They’ll know what happens when they take action, and fewer files will be lost accidentally.
Explore file recovery

Dropbox + AI
More than store
Dropbox is already home to millions of people’s most important content. As a platform-agnostic company, we're in a unique position to help organize our customers’ entire working lives and deliver experiences powered by AI/ML so they can quickly discover, access, and manage all their content — right from Dropbox.
What's new
Introducing Dropbox Dash for Business
Dash, our new AI-powered universal search tool, makes it easy for teams to search, organize, share, and protect content from across their connected apps, all in one place. Dash for Business combines universal search and organization with in-depth content access control for businesses big and small, giving IT admins visibility and control over the content people share and access.
Learn more about our new initiatives
What's next
Dropbox was founded because we needed a better way of storing and accessing our content. With Dash for Business, we’re harnessing AI to create a more streamlined and secure solution to the knowledge fragmentation problem. And we’ve heard great things from companies like McLaren Formula 1 Team, which has already seen meaningful results.

"When sharing files, security doesn’t have to come at the expense of usability. Dropbox gives us peace of mind about the security of our files."
View case study
Harry White, General Manager, Future Classic
"If I see a candidate has spent a lot of time on a particular part of our recruiting pitch deck, like slides about culture or the technical details of our product, I use this to guide my conversation and decisions like who they should speak with next. The analytics allow me to provide a more personalized candidate experience."
Brittney Harvey, Recruiter, Bond
"Dropbox makes it easy to manage the big, heavy data every day. We just send links to our clients, and they immediately get what they need."
Ai Ando, Account Supervisor, Dentsu
"I don’t have anything on my computer that lives outside Dropbox. I know that I can reach it on any device."
Billy Kiely, VP of Product, InVision
"It sounds simple, but Dropbox just makes collaboration easier for employees. For the most part, users can manage their own folders and file structures because it’s straightforward for them."
Lane Blanchard, IT Director, College of Pharmacy, University of Florida
"With Dropbox Sign in Freshsales CPQ, sales teams can move faster from quote to cash."
Prakash Ramamurthy, Chief Product Officer, Freshworks
"I’m now able to see when investors look through our documents. DocSend’s analytics have taken the guesswork out of managing investor relationships."
Viraj Mane, Co-founder and Chief Scientific Officer, Lactiga
"Thanks to DocSend, prospects experience our white-glove treatment from the initial demo to the signed contract."

Easier than the competition
Dropbox Backup users ranked Dropbox Backup as more intuitive and easier to use than Backblaze and Carbonite in a recent study comparing top backup solutions.*
*Based on a 2021 Dropbox research survey of registered Dropbox users who have used Dropbox Backup
What Backup customers are saying
“Dropbox Backup calms my anxiety a bit. I've been using my work computer for a year now, but since it is from 2012 I know there's a possibility that it will freeze, fail, or die soon. But everything is backed up. That's a huge relief.”
Gina Olson, United States
“To me, Dropbox Backup is a good alternative to Carbon Copy Cloner, because I know it’s a complete identical index in the cloud, and it is integrated right into Dropbox with the rest of my files. For me it’s super important to have those external drives thoroughly indexed, safely backed up, and available wherever I am.”
Peter Ferguson, Nashville, TN
“With Dropbox Backup, I don’t have to think about the last time my computer backed itself up. It’s seamless. It gets set up, it has a task to do and it does its job. I don’t have to think about it doing its job.”
C. Gage, United States
“Dropbox Backup is excellent. You can easily back up all the files that you want to, make changes anytime, choose which folders you want to back up, and access your files everywhere.”
Arvin Velarde, United States
“Dropbox Backup has improved my productivity since I don't have to spend so much time backing up my work to portable hard drives or syncing files to Dropbox. It also made it very easy to transfer all my files when I bought a new computer!”
Ekaterina Borschov-Badano, United States
“With Dropbox Backup, you have a complete backup of information so if you were to lose it, you have an easy way to get it back and access it all in one spot.”
Alex Geller, United States
“Dropbox Backup has been great—I really like it. I was using another platform called CrashPlan and I didn’t really love it that much. With Dropbox Backup, it’s nice because it fits in with my workflow. I’m so used to using Dropbox for everything else and I prefer to have everything in one place anyway.”
M. Collins, United States

"It's been pretty great to have everything in one place, on one unified and cohesive platform, where the products and features augment each other. I love that I can log into the Dropbox platform and manage multiple client projects in one place, instead of needing several separate software platforms. Dropbox makes it easy to manage all the moving parts and pieces."

Dropbox Terms of Service
Posted: January 7, 2025
Effective: January 7, 2025
You can see your previous Terms here.
Thanks for using Dropbox! Our mission is to create a more enlightened way of working, and help you and those you work with stay coordinated. We do so by providing an intuitive, unified platform and suite of apps and services that keep your content safe, accessible and in sync. These terms of service (“Terms”) cover your use and access to our services, client software and websites ("Services"). If you reside outside of the United States of America, Canada and Mexico (“North America”) your agreement is with Dropbox International Unlimited Company. If you reside in North America your agreement is with Dropbox, Inc. Our Privacy Policy explains how we collect and use your information while our Acceptable Use Policy outlines your responsibilities when using our Services. If you are a member of a paid multi-user team (or a trial of a paid multi-user team) where an admin has control of your account ("Dropbox Team"), your team will also be bound to the Dropbox Services Agreement or another agreement between Dropbox and your team, and you will continue to remain subject to these Terms. By using our Services, you’re agreeing to be bound by these Terms, our Privacy Policy, and Acceptable Use Policy.
Your Stuff & Your Permissions
When you use our Services, you provide us with things like your files, content, messages, contacts, connected services, and so on (“Your Stuff”). Your Stuff is yours. These Terms don’t give us any rights to Your Stuff except for the limited rights that enable us to offer the Services.
You may need to register for an account to access the Services, and we may create an account for you so that you can interact with the Services.
Our Services include a suite of apps and websites. To help you stay productive, when you use the same account to access different parts of the suite, Your Stuff may come with you.
We need your permission to do things like hosting Your Stuff, backing it up, and sharing it when you ask us to. Our Services also provide you with features like commenting, sharing, searching, image thumbnails, document previews, optical character recognition (OCR), easy sorting and organization, and personalization to help reduce busywork. To provide these and other features, Dropbox accesses, stores, and scans Your Stuff. You give us permission to do those things, and this permission extends to our affiliates and trusted third parties we work with.
Your Responsibilities
Your use of our Services must comply with our Acceptable Use Policy. Content in the Services may be protected by others’ intellectual property rights. Please don’t copy, upload, download, or share content unless you have the right to do so.
Dropbox may review your conduct and content for compliance with these Terms and our Acceptable Use Policy. We aren’t responsible for the content people post and share via the Services.
Help us keep Your Stuff protected. Safeguard your password to the Services, and keep your account information current. Don’t share your account credentials or give others access to your account.
You may use our Services only as permitted by applicable law, including export control laws and regulations. Finally, to use our Services, you must be at least 13 if you reside in the United States, and 16 if you reside anywhere else. If the law where you reside requires that you must be older in order for Dropbox to lawfully provide the Services to you without parental consent (including use of your personal data), then you must be that older age.
Software
Some of our Services allow you to download client software (“Software”) which may update automatically. So long as you comply with these Terms, we give you a limited, nonexclusive, nontransferable, revocable license to use the Software, solely to access the Services. To the extent any component of the Software may be offered under an open source license, we’ll make that license available to you and the provisions of that license may expressly override some of these Terms. Unless the following restrictions are prohibited by law, you agree not to reverse engineer or decompile the Services, attempt to do so, or assist anyone in doing so.
Beta Services
We sometimes release products and features that we’re still testing and evaluating (“Beta Services”). Beta Services are labeled “alpha,” “beta,” “preview,” “early access,” or “evaluation” (or with words or phrases with similar meanings) and may not be as reliable as Dropbox’s other services. Beta Services are made available so that we can collect user feedback, and by using our Beta Services, you agree that we may contact you to collect such feedback.
Beta Services are confidential until official launch. If you use any Beta Services, you agree not to disclose any information about those Services to anyone else without our permission.
Electronic Signatures
By using a part of the Services that facilitates electronic signatures, you agree to do business electronically and to use electronic records and signatures. There may be laws where you reside governing what types of documents and transactions are appropriate for such signatures. It’s your responsibility to ensure that the electronic signature functionality provided by the Services is appropriate for your scenario.
Templates and Forms
The Services may include sample templates and forms (“Templates”). Templates are for informational purposes only. We are not attorneys or a law firm, and our Templates are not a substitute for the advice or services of an attorney. You acknowledge that Dropbox is not providing you with legal advice or acting as your attorney or agent, and you assume full responsibility for any outcomes or costs associated with your use of our Templates.
Dropbox does not claim that documents based on the Templates are complete and suitable for use in all situations and jurisdictions. You should consult with an attorney about your specific situation before relying on the Templates for any contract, agreement or transaction. You hereby acknowledge that Dropbox is not a party to any agreement that you enter into as a result of the use of any document that you create or use through the Services. Use of the Services and any document (including any document based on the Templates) does not constitute an attorney-client relationship, joint venture or partnership between Dropbox and any user or third party. Communications between you and Dropbox are governed by these Terms and our Privacy Policy but are not protected by the attorney-client privilege or as work product.
We hope you’re satisfied with the Templates. If you have any concerns, please click here for more information and instructions on how to contact us.
The disclaimers of warranties and limitations of liability below do not apply to consumers in North Carolina when using the Templates.
Fax Services
If you use a part of the Services that facilitates faxing, you may be required to provide information such as your name, billing address, physical address, payment information (including credit card number), and national ID number (where applicable). Failure to provide this information could result in suspension of your access.
You may not use our Services to send unsolicited fax advertisements or spam, and we may decide to not deliver any messages we consider unsolicited fax advertisements or spam.
We cannot guarantee that any particular fax number will be available for you to use. If you stop using our fax services, your number may be released or reassigned to another customer. In the US, UK, and Canada, we may support porting a fax number (both in and out) for an additional fee.
Additional Features
From time to time, Dropbox will add additional features to enhance the user experience of our storage service at no additional charge. However, these free features may be withdrawn without further notice.
Third-Party Features
The Services may give you the option to link to third-party features and integrations. Dropbox does not own or operate any such features or integrations. If you access or use any third-party features or integrations, you are responsible for this access and use, and Dropbox is not responsible for any act or omission of the third party or the availability, accuracy, the related content, products or services of third parties.
Our Stuff
The Services are protected by copyright, trademark, and other US and foreign laws. These Terms don’t grant you any right, title, or interest in the Services, others’ content in the Services, Dropbox trademarks, logos and other brand features. We welcome feedback, but note that we may use comments or suggestions without any obligation to you.
Copyright
We respect the intellectual property of others and ask that you do too. We respond to notices of alleged copyright infringement if they comply with the law, and such notices should be reported using our Copyright Policy. We reserve the right to delete or disable content alleged to be infringing and terminate accounts of repeat infringers. Copyright infringement claims should be submitted using our Copyright Complaint Form or submitted to our designated agent for our Services at:
Copyright Agent
Dropbox, Inc.
1800 Owens St
San Francisco, CA 94158
copyright@dropbox.com
Paid Accounts
Billing. You can increase your storage space and add paid features to your account (turning your account into a “Paid Account”). We’ll automatically bill you from the date you convert to a Paid Account and on each periodic renewal until cancellation. If you’re on an annual plan, we’ll send you a notice email reminding you that your plan is about to renew within a reasonable period of time prior to the renewal date. You’re responsible for all applicable taxes, and we’ll charge tax when required to do so. Some countries have mandatory local laws regarding your cancellation rights, and this paragraph doesn’t override these laws.
Cancellation. You may cancel your Paid Account at any time. Refunds are only issued if required by law. For example, users living in the European Union have the right to cancel their Paid Account subscriptions and obtain a refund within 14 days of signing up for, upgrading to, or renewing a Paid Account by clicking here.
Downgrades. Your Paid Account will remain in effect until it's cancelled or terminated under these Terms. If you’re on a Dropbox Family plan, the Family manager may be able to downgrade your account at any time. If you don’t pay for your Paid Account on time, we reserve the right to suspend it or remove Paid Account features.
Changes. We may change the fees in effect on renewal of your subscription, to reflect factors such as changes to our product offerings, changes to our business, or changes in economic conditions. We’ll give you no less than 30 days’ advance notice of these changes via a message to the email address associated with your account and you’ll have the opportunity to cancel your subscription before the new fee comes into effect.
Dropbox Teams
Email address. If you sign up for a Dropbox account with an email address provisioned by your organization, your organization may be able to block your use of Dropbox until you transition to an account on a Dropbox Team or you associate your Dropbox account with a personal email address.
Using Dropbox Teams. If you join a Dropbox Team, you must use it in compliance with your organization’s terms and policies. Please note that Dropbox Team accounts are subject to your organization's control. Your administrators may be able to access, disclose, restrict, or remove information in or from your Dropbox Team account. They may also be able to restrict or terminate your access to a Dropbox Team account. If you convert an existing Dropbox account into part of a Dropbox Team, your administrators may prevent you from later disassociating your account from the Dropbox Team.
Termination
You’re free to stop using our Services at any time. We reserve the right to suspend or terminate your access to the Services with notice to you if Dropbox reasonably believes:
you’re in breach of these Terms,
your use of the Services would cause a real risk of harm or loss to us or other users, or
you don’t have a Paid Account and haven't accessed our Services for 12 consecutive months.
We’ll provide you with reasonable advance notice via the email address associated with your account to remedy the activity that prompted us to contact you and give you the opportunity to export Your Stuff from our Services. If after such notice you fail to take the steps we ask of you, we’ll terminate or suspend your access to the Services.
We won’t provide notice or an opportunity to export Your Stuff before termination or suspension of access to the Services where Dropbox reasonably believes:
you’re in material breach of these Terms, which includes, but is not limited to, violating our Acceptable Use Policy,
doing so would cause us legal liability or compromise our ability to provide the Services to our other users, or
we're prohibited from doing so by law.
Once we suspend or terminate your access to the Services, you will not be able to access or export Your Stuff. Dropbox does not provide refunds if we suspend or terminate your access to the Services, unless required by law.
Discontinuation of Services
We may decide to discontinue the Services in response to exceptional unforeseen circumstances, events beyond Dropbox’s control (for example a natural disaster, fire, or explosion), or to comply with a legal requirement. If we do so, we’ll give you reasonable prior notice so that you can export Your Stuff from our systems (we will give you no less than 30 days’ notice where possible under the circumstances). If we discontinue the Services in this way before the end of any fixed or minimum term you have paid us for, we’ll refund the portion of the fees you have pre-paid but haven't received Services for.
Services “AS IS”
We strive to provide great Services, but there are certain things that we can't guarantee. TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, DROPBOX AND ITS AFFILIATES, SUPPLIERS AND DISTRIBUTORS MAKE NO WARRANTIES, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, ABOUT THE SERVICES. THE SERVICES ARE PROVIDED "AS IS." WE ALSO DISCLAIM ANY WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT. Some places don’t allow the disclaimers in this paragraph, so they may not apply to you. For example, these disclaimers do not override the legal protections, including statutory warranties, granted to consumers by EU law.
Limitation of Liability
WE DON’T EXCLUDE OR LIMIT OUR LIABILITY TO YOU WHERE IT WOULD BE ILLEGAL TO DO SO—THIS INCLUDES ANY LIABILITY FOR DROPBOX’S OR ITS AFFILIATES’ FRAUD OR FRAUDULENT MISREPRESENTATION IN PROVIDING THE SERVICES. IN COUNTRIES WHERE THE FOLLOWING TYPES OF EXCLUSIONS AREN’T ALLOWED, WE'RE RESPONSIBLE TO YOU ONLY FOR LOSSES AND DAMAGES THAT ARE A REASONABLY FORESEEABLE RESULT OF OUR FAILURE TO USE REASONABLE CARE AND SKILL OR OUR BREACH OF OUR CONTRACT WITH YOU. THIS PARAGRAPH DOESN’T AFFECT CONSUMER RIGHTS THAT CAN'T BE WAIVED OR LIMITED BY ANY CONTRACT OR AGREEMENT. IF YOU ARE AN EU OR UK CONSUMER, THESE TERMS DO NOT EXCLUDE DROPBOX’S LIABILITY FOR LOSSES AND DAMAGES THAT ARE A RESULT OF OUR FAILURE TO USE REASONABLE CARE AND SKILL IN PROVIDING THE SERVICES OR OF OUR BREACH OF OUR CONTRACT WITH YOU, AS LONG AS THOSE LOSSES AND DAMAGES ARE REASONABLY FORESEEABLE.
IN COUNTRIES WHERE EXCLUSIONS OR LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY ARE ALLOWED, DROPBOX, ITS AFFILIATES, SUPPLIERS OR DISTRIBUTORS WON’T BE LIABLE FOR:
ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, PUNITIVE, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, OR
ANY LOSS OF USE, DATA, BUSINESS, OR PROFITS, REGARDLESS OF LEGAL THEORY.
THESE EXCLUSIONS OR LIMITATIONS WILL APPLY REGARDLESS OF WHETHER OR NOT DROPBOX OR ANY OF ITS AFFILIATES HAS BEEN WARNED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
IF YOU USE THE SERVICES FOR ANY COMMERCIAL, BUSINESS, OR RE-SALE PURPOSE, DROPBOX, ITS AFFILIATES, SUPPLIERS OR DISTRIBUTORS WILL HAVE NO LIABILITY TO YOU FOR ANY LOSS OF PROFIT, LOSS OF BUSINESS, BUSINESS INTERRUPTION, OR LOSS OF BUSINESS OPPORTUNITY. DROPBOX AND ITS AFFILIATES AREN’T RESPONSIBLE FOR THE CONDUCT, WHETHER ONLINE OR OFFLINE, OF ANY USER OF THE SERVICES.
OTHER THAN FOR THE TYPES OF LIABILITY WE CANNOT LIMIT BY LAW (AS DESCRIBED IN THIS SECTION), WE LIMIT OUR LIABILITY TO YOU TO THE GREATER OF $20 USD OR 100% OF ANY AMOUNT YOU'VE PAID UNDER YOUR CURRENT SERVICE PLAN WITH DROPBOX. THIS PROVISION DOES NOT APPLY TO EU CONSUMERS WHERE PROHIBITED BY APPLICABLE LAW.
Resolving Disputes
Let’s Try to Sort Things Out First. We want to address your concerns without needing a formal legal case. Before filing a claim against Dropbox, you agree to try to resolve the dispute informally by sending us a written Notice of Dispute at dispute-notice@dropbox.com that includes your name, a detailed description of the dispute, and the relief you seek. We’ll try to resolve the dispute informally by contacting you via email. If a dispute is not resolved within 60 days after submission, you or Dropbox may bring a formal proceeding. If you reside in the EU, the European Commission provides for an online dispute resolution platform, which you can access here: https://ec.europa.eu/consumers/odr.
Judicial Forum for Disputes. You and Dropbox agree that any judicial proceeding to resolve claims relating to these Terms or the Services will be brought in the federal or state courts of San Francisco County, California, subject to the mandatory arbitration provisions below. Both you and Dropbox consent to venue and personal jurisdiction in such courts. If you reside in a country (for example, a member state of the European Union) with laws that give consumers the right to bring disputes in their local courts, this paragraph doesn’t affect those requirements. The venue and exclusive jurisdiction provision above does not apply to North Carolina consumers with respect to claims relating to or arising out of use of the Templates.
IF YOU’RE A U.S. RESIDENT, YOU ALSO AGREE TO THE FOLLOWING MANDATORY ARBITRATION PROVISIONS:
We Both Agree to Arbitrate. You and Dropbox agree to resolve any claims relating to or arising out of these Terms or the Services through final and binding individual arbitration by a single arbitrator, except as set forth under the “Exceptions to Agreement to Arbitrate” below. This includes disputes arising out of or relating to the interpretation or application of this “Mandatory Arbitration Provisions” section, including its scope, enforceability, revocability, or validity. The arbitrator may award relief only individually and only to the extent necessary to redress your individual claim(s); the arbitrator may not award relief on behalf of others or the general public.
Opt out of Agreement to Arbitrate. You can decline this agreement to arbitrate by clicking here and submitting the opt-out form within 30 days of first registering your account or agreeing to these Terms. However, if you agreed to a previous version of these Terms that allowed you to opt out of arbitration, your previous choice to opt out or not opt out remains binding.
Arbitration Procedures. The American Arbitration Association (AAA) will administer the arbitration under its Consumer Arbitration Rules. The AAA’s rules and filing instructions are available at www.adr.org or by calling 1-800-778-7879. The arbitration will be held in the United States county where you live or work, San Francisco (CA), or any other location we agree to. For North Carolina consumers, for claims relating to or arising out of use of the Templates, the arbitration will be held in North Carolina or any other location we agree to.
Arbitration Fees and Incentives. The AAA rules will govern payment of all arbitration fees. For individual arbitration of non-frivolous claims less than $75,000 for which you timely provided Dropbox with a Notice of Dispute, Dropbox will reimburse arbitration filing fees at the conclusion of the arbitration and will pay other arbitration fees. For all other claims, the costs and fees of arbitration shall be allocated in accordance with the arbitration provider’s rules, including rules regarding frivolous or improper claims. If you receive an arbitration award that is more favorable than any offer we make to resolve the claim, we will pay you $1,000 in addition to the award. Dropbox will not seek its attorneys' fees and costs in arbitration unless the arbitrator determines that your claim is frivolous or brought for an improper purpose.
Exceptions to Agreement to Arbitrate. Either you or Dropbox may assert claims, if they qualify, in small claims court in San Francisco (CA) or any United States county where you live or work. Either party may bring a lawsuit solely for injunctive relief to stop unauthorized use or abuse of the Services, or intellectual property infringement (for example, trademark, trade secret, copyright, or patent rights) without first engaging in arbitration or the informal dispute-resolution process described above. If the agreement to arbitrate is found not to apply to you or your claim, you agree to the exclusive jurisdiction of the state and federal courts in San Francisco County, California to resolve your claim. This exclusive jurisdiction provision does not apply to North Carolina consumers with respect to claims relating to or arising out of use of the Templates.
NO CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTIONS. You may only resolve disputes with us on an individual basis, and may not bring a claim as a plaintiff or a class member in a class, consolidated, or representative action. Class arbitrations, class actions, private attorney general actions, and consolidation with other arbitrations aren’t allowed.
Severability. If any part of this “Mandatory Arbitration Provisions” section is found to be illegal or unenforceable, the remainder will remain in effect, except that if a finding of partial illegality or unenforceability would allow class or representative arbitration, this “Mandatory Arbitration Provisions” section will be unenforceable in its entirety. If you are found to have a non-waivable right to bring a particular claim or to request a particular form of relief that the arbitrator lacks authority to redress or award according to this “Mandatory Arbitration Provisions” section, including public injunctive relief, then only that respective claim or request for relief may be brought in court, and you and we agree that litigation of any such claim or request for relief shall be stayed pending the resolution of any individual claim(s) or request(s) for relief in arbitration.
Controlling Law
These Terms will be governed by California law except for its conflicts of laws principles. However, some countries (including those in the European Union) have laws that require agreements to be governed by the local laws of the consumer's country. This paragraph doesn’t override those laws.
Entire Agreement
These Terms constitute the entire agreement between you and Dropbox with respect to the subject matter of these Terms, and supersede and replace any other prior or contemporaneous agreements, or terms and conditions applicable to the subject matter of these Terms. Our past, present, and future affiliates and agents can invoke our rights under this agreement in the event they become involved in a dispute with you. Otherwise, these Terms do not give rights to any third parties.
Waiver, Severability & Assignment
Dropbox’s failure to enforce a provision is not a waiver of its right to do so later. If a provision is found unenforceable, the remaining provisions of the Terms will remain in full effect and an enforceable term will be substituted reflecting our intent as closely as possible. You may not assign any of your rights under these Terms, and any such attempt will be void. Dropbox may assign its rights to any of its affiliates or subsidiaries, or to any successor in interest of any business associated with the Services.
Modifications
We may revise these Terms to better reflect:
changes to the law,
new regulatory requirements, or
improvements or enhancements made to our Services.
If an update affects your use of the Services or your legal rights as a user of our Services, we’ll notify you prior to the update's effective date by sending an email to the email address associated with your account or via an in-product notification. These updated terms will be effective no less than 30 days from when we notify you.
If you don’t agree to the updates we make, please cancel your account and stop using the Services before the updated Terms become effective. Where applicable, we’ll offer you a prorated refund based on the amounts you have prepaid for Services and your account cancellation date. By continuing to use or access the Services after the updates come into effect, you agree to be bound by the revised Terms.

What are the benefits of converting files to PDF format?
There are many reasons why you might want to convert a file to a PDF, for example:
Content and formatting
When sharing a raw file, the recipient can edit it freely when they open it, and some aspects may not display as intended. With a PDF, the fonts and format are locked, making it a more reliable way to share finished work.
File format restrictions
When uploading files to certain platforms, or attaching them to online forms, formats can be restricted. PDFs are commonly accepted as they can contain documents, images, scans, and more—all within a small file size.
File size
PDFs can often be smaller than other formats, making them convenient for sharing in situations where file size limits are important.
Frequently asked questions

Know what content is shared
Back up any file—anywhere, anytime
Whether you’re trying to back up an image collection, a large video, a CAD file, or entire folders, you can store all your important files safely in your Dropbox account. With access to your Dropbox files from any device, operating system or platform, you can work and collaborate on projects with ease. No internet connection? No problem.
With Dropbox, you can work on files while offline, from your desktop computer, Android, iPhone, or iPad. Once you get back online, your files and folders will automatically sync with any edits you made when you weren’t connected.
Keep your files in sync
Get extra assurance
Losing precious family photos or unintentionally deleting work files because your phone goes missing or your external drive stops working can be stressful. Accidents happen, but cloud storage services from Dropbox help make disaster recovery easier.
When you move or delete a file in your Dropbox folder or on the web, we’ll confirm it’s the action you want to take. This ensures fewer chances that accidental data loss will occur. Relax knowing that all of your important files are safe in the cloud.
Keep your files safe
Recover your files
If your files are accidentally deleted, lost, or updated too early, there’s no need to worry. With file recovery and version history, you can restore your deleted files or previous versions of work without missing a beat. By default, Dropbox stores all of your individual files, including early versions of files, for a full 30 days—or 180 days for Dropbox Standard, Advanced, and Enterprise plans.

How can I easily transfer large files without hassle using Dropbox?
Securely transferring a large file or collection of files in real time—for example, a design project or set of high-resolution photos—is simple with Dropbox Transfer. Easily drag and drop files without uploading them to the cloud, worrying about storage space, permissions, or managing file access.
Deliver any large file quickly
Deliver up to 250 GB of files to anyone—even if they don’t have a Dropbox account. You can easily make large file transfers by sending an email or copying a download link to share with recipients.
More about large files
Guarantee files get delivered
Confirm delivery of your file transfers with download notifications, control access with password protection, and set expiration dates for shared links to encourage immediate downloads.

Director and Founder, Entrust

Know what content is shared
How Dropbox keeps your files and data secure
Account security
Two-factor authentication, user and device management, and a zero-knowledge password manager keeps your account secure from unknown login attempts.
File protection and encryption
Secure 256-bit AES and SSL/TLS encryption technology keeps your files safe from harm during data transfer.
File sharing and permissions
Advanced sharing controls like password protection, expiration dates, and easy revocation of files and folders help ensure that only the right people have access.
File and folder recovery
Don’t live in fear of file loss. Easily recover files, folders, and older versions of content—with multiple ways to restore your data.
Data breach security
We keep our systems safe from bad actors, with vulnerability testing, dark web monitoring, and enterprise detection and response capabilities.
Compliance
Dropbox meets global regulatory standards for many of your data handling and file storage needs, including GDPR compliance and support for HIPAA compliance for teams.
Account security
Keep your account secure
Dropbox account security features help to protect your account from being accessed without your knowledge and approval.
Two-factor authentication—require a six-digit security code or key in addition to a password to access your account.
Device approval and management—get notified of logins from new devices, and remotely wipe Dropbox data from any device used to access your account.
Dropbox Passwords—a zero-knowledge password manager to store, sync, and autofill your login details to seamlessly sign in to websites and apps. No one has access but you, not even Dropbox.
Compare plans
File protection and encryption
Give your files the best protection possible
Protecting files at rest—256-bit Advanced Encryption Standard (AES), the strongest method of AES encryption available, makes the files in your cloud storage virtually-impossible to crack. It would take billions of years to break into a file protected in this way using current technology and so-called “brute force” methods.
Protecting files in transit—Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) and Transport Layer Security (TLS) are used to protect data as it transfers between Dropbox apps and our servers.
File sharing and permissions
Know who has access and revoke quickly and easily
Share in confidence. Dropbox provides multiple ways to share and monitor access to your files and folders:
Share folders, links and files—no matter what you’re working on, or who you’re working with, securely share folders, links, and files from your cloud storage.
File locking—lock files while editing to prevent unwanted edits from collaborators and avoid conflicting copies.
File permissions—granular file permissions give you the power to control who can access individual folders and files, and the level of access permissions they have for each.
Password-protected files and folders—password protect files and folders, to add an extra layer of security.
External content reporting dashboard—view all files and folders shared outside of your team in a centralized dashboard. Require a password and expiration date for externally-shared links, and easily revoke access when necessary.
File and folder recovery
An additional safety net for your files and folders
Give yourself peace of mind, reassured that your files are safe from accidental deletion, unwanted edits, or damage to your devices.
Version history—roll files back to earlier versions without needing to create additional copies.
File recovery—restore deleted files back into your cloud storage.
Dropbox Rewind—recover from accidents or ransomware by reversing all changes to your content at the folder or account level.
Dropbox Backup—automatically Backup computers—and connected external drives—directly to the cloud. Should anything ever go wrong, it’s quick to recover your content to any device.
Compare plans
Data breach security
Always-on protection for your account and data
The threat of data breaches and large-scale attacks requires constant vigilance. Our systems continuously monitor for and automatically react to signs of exposed account data.
Vulnerability testing—Dropbox applications and infrastructure are regularly tested for security vulnerabilities, and hardened to enhance security and protect against attacks.
Dark web monitoring—we continuously monitor the dark web for signs of data breaches, with automated systems to notify you if your information has been compromised.
Ransomware detection—always-on monitoring quickly alerts you to potential attacks, and Dropbox helps recover your content without paying a ransom.
Breach alerts and notifications—get immediately alerted to suspicious behavior like ransomware attacks, mass file deletion, excessive login attempts, and login attempts from unfamiliar or suspicious locations.
Compliance
Compliance for your files and data
Save yourself the admin headache ahead of an audit and ensure all of your files are compliant from day one.
GDPR compliant—GDPR compliance and requirements are a top Dropbox priority. In line with our commitment to the protection of our users’ data, we work hard to ensure that Dropbox and its services are GDPR compliant.
Support for HIPAA compliance—we’re committed to helping customers subject to HIPAA/HITECH regulations safeguard protected health information (PHI).
SOC 1, 2, and 3 compliance reports—when you have high volumes of sensitive data in the cloud, you require superior security, privacy, and compliance controls— and regular reports on their effectiveness.
Data classification—stay compliant with privacy and security policies. Automatically track and report on sensitive or confidential information in your cloud storage.
Data Governance Add-On—secure and control your corporate data so you can meet your regulatory and compliance needs, while also reducing the risk and costs of not meeting them.

Data security at Dropbox
“While we no longer work in a shared physical space, we get to experience a shared virtual space via Dropbox. We continue to share files, archive meetings, collaborate on documents, sign contracts, and celebrate our team progress.”
View case study
— Maisie Ho
IT Manager, Figma
“We wanted what people felt most comfortable with from a user interface, security, and deployment perspective. It needed to work well with Macs, PCs, smartphones — all of the above. It brought us back to one answer, which was Dropbox.”
— Chris Pesola
Director of IT, Plex Systems
“When you’re constantly trying to operate as fast as possible, you can’t afford to get bogged down with things like tracking down the latest version of a video or trying to send extremely large files over email. With Dropbox, our employees can access and share all their work from one place. This way, we can keep focused on building our business.”
— Joe Ziemer
Head of Communications and Partnerships, Betterment
“A lot of times when we deploy software, we first hear about the challenges. But during our phased deployment of Dropbox, we mostly just heard employees saying, ‘Can I get that now?’”
— Chris Burgess
VP of IT, Expedia

Know what content is shared
Send big and small files, to anyone
Need to send a large media file, CAD drawing, video file, or graphics-heavy report? With Dropbox, you can send large file types to anyone—on any device.
When sending or sharing large files with another Dropbox user, just create a secure shared link. With Dropbox Transfer, you can send files up to 100 GB (or 250 GB with the Dropbox Replay Add-On)—without taking up space in your Dropbox account.
Recipients can view and download your file—even if they don't have Dropbox.
Learn about shared links
Securely send big files with a shared link
Wondering how to send a large file via email safely or what happens to your email attachments after you send them off? 
Sharing large files with Dropbox guarantees you're always in control. Your recipients can view, comment on, and download any large file link you send from Dropbox—but they won't be able to edit the original.
You can also password protect a shared file link and set a date for it to expire. Or, if you want to give recipients the ability to edit your shared files, simply invite them to a shared folder and put the files inside. You can start sending files via email securely during a Dropbox free trial.

Deliver all your large final product files with Transfer
Ready to share or send the final full-resolution video files, ad campaign assets, or other cumbersome data? 
With Dropbox Transfer, you can send large files up to 100 GB without taking up space in your Dropbox account. If you need more juice, get our Creative Tools Add-On to transfer up to 250 GB.
Try Dropbox Transfer for free
Add large files and easily share using your favorite tools
Dropbox integrates seamlessly with popular apps to make sharing large files easy. Share content, big and small, to Slack channels, Zoom Meetings, Microsoft 365, Google Workspaces, and more—directly from Dropbox.
Learn about popular app integrations
Preview dozens of large file types
Dropbox makes sharing easy and convenient for anyone you send a large file. File recipients can view and comment on any file—including Photoshop, Excel, and Sketch files—even if they don’t have those apps installed. It’s a great way to work efficiently across a team.

View case study
Tom Otis, Ph.D.
Chief Scientific Officer, University College London
“The joint power of Dropbox and Blackboard has allowed us to significantly improve the collaboration process between faculty and students. These newly improved workflows are enhancing our efforts to move course curriculum from the computer to the classroom.”
Dr. Henry Torres
CIO, Arkansas State University
“I’ve been using Dropbox personally and professionally for a very long time,. It’s just the easiest and most efficient way to house living folders and documents that my colleagues, trainees and patients can access in real time.”
Dr. Christina Han
Associate Clinical Professor of Obstetrics and Gynecology and Division Director of Maternal-Fetal Medicine
“File requests have provided a very fast and simple way of collecting large amounts of data from my collaborators, who are located around the world. Using a file request removes any concerns I might have with file sizes or storage quotas, and enables me to get the data I need without much thought or coordination.”
Dr. Min Shin
Professor and Assistant Dean, Computer Science, UNC Charlotte
“Dropbox provides an amazing balance of feature-rich usability and security. At Wharton, our mission is to create and share business knowledge; we leverage Dropbox to enable seamless collaboration between faculty and students both on and off campus while protecting their cutting-edge academic research and other sensitive data.”
Dan Alig
CIO, Wharton School, University of Pennsylvania
“We have a large faculty of researchers in fields like medicine who work with sensitive data and require higher levels of security. Because Dropbox is HIPAA compliant, these employees can be confident their information is secure and all in one place. That peace-of-mind means they can focus solely on the research.”
Lane Blanchard
IT Director, College of Pharmacy, University of Florida
“We deployed Dropbox Business to ensure that the University, its students, staff, research, and global partners can continue to learn, teach, and innovate truly world-class ideas securely without disruption.”
