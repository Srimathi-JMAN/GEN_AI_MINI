BrokerCheck is a free tool created by the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA)
to research the background and experience of financial advisers and firms.
Why Use BrokerCheck?
BrokerCheck helps you make informed choices about brokers and brokerage firms-and provides easy access to investment adviser information.
BrokerCheck tells you instantly whether a person or firm is registered, as required by law, to sell securities (stocks, bonds, mutual funds and more), offer investment advice or both.
BrokerCheck gives you a snapshot of a broker's employment history, regulatory actions, and investment-related licensing information, arbitrations and complaints.
Want more information about financial brokers & advisers?
Browse the list of brokers barred by FINRA.
Check out the new SEC Action Lookup tool for formal actions that the SEC has brought against individuals, including those who are not brokers.
Go to your state securities regulator to do additional research on brokers and investment advisers.
BrokerCheck does not have information regarding civil litigation not involving investments, civil protective orders, criminal matters unless they are felonies, or misdemeanors that are investment-related or involve theft or a "breach of trust." Consider doing an internet search to check for that type of information.
Who is FINRA? FINRA is an independent, non-governmental regulator for all securities firms doing business with the public in the United States. We are authorized by Congress to protect America’s investors by making sure the securities industry operates fairly and honestly.

What We Value
at Robinhood
Safety First
Robinhood is a safety first company. We create with care, make changes thoughtfully, and we obsess over details. We don't compromise regulatory requirements to move fast, and when we see something amiss, we move quickly to correct it. We take risks responsibly with safety as the foundation of innovation.
Radical Customer Focus
Customers are at the center of our company. We listen to them, design for their needs, and aim to make our user experience simple and intuitive. We put what's best for customers at the center of decision-making. When there are customer pain points, we fix them quickly.
Participation is Power
We empower a new generation of investors. We seek to enable everyone to participate in the financial system and we deliver products to help them accomplish their long-term financial goals. We educate and empower our customers and strive to make the financial industry more inclusive. We were founded on the ideal that the rich shouldn't get a better deal, so we treat people fairly and strive to deliver exceptional value.
One Robinhood
We're all invested in the same mission. We earn the trust of our colleagues by being honest, inclusive, and transparent. We invite diverse perspectives, support each other, and engage in lively but kind debate in pursuit of our path forward. When decisions are made we move in unison with an ownership mentality. We hold ourselves accountable but never point the finger or evade responsibility, and we treat everyone with respect and grace.
High Performance
Our first instinct is to take action. We strive for improvement and push for progress; and when something is broken, we fix it. We are driven by impact and constantly go after big opportunities. We are making Robinhood a place people want to be by investing in our employees, leveraging diverse perspectives, and rewarding top performance.
First-Principles Thinking
We are inventors, dreamers, and problem solvers. We question assumptions and seek creative solutions rather than just following the crowd. We use data and experiments to inform our decisions, but we also make bold bets, challenge the status quo, and are often a first mover. And ultimately, we bravely do what's right even when it's scary and hasn't been done before.
Lean and Disciplined
We do more with less. We pursue operational excellence so that we can deliver exceptional value to customers. We set ambitious goals, monitor progress, and regularly benchmark our performance to increase efficiency and effectiveness. We are respectful of each other's time, so when we change course we do so intentionally after weighing the tradeoffs.
Working at Robinhood
At Robinhood, our culture thrives on in-person collaboration and a strong commitment to community. Most roles are office-based, with team members coming together at least three days a week to foster creativity and innovation. Our collective effort extends beyond business, deeply rooted in democratizing finance and driving meaningful community engagement.

US stocks retreat on tech- and tariff-fueled sell-offMajor indexes moved lower in a topsy-turvy session that saw the S&P 500 rebound from early losses only to stumble into the close. The benchmark US stock index fell 0.3%, the Russell 2000 gave back 0.5%, and the Nasdaq 100 slumped 0.6%.
Despite all the tariff headlines swirling, it was energy stocks and tech that performed the worst among S&P 500 sector ETFs.
Old-school US automakers tumbled on the imposition of tariffs, with those that sell a relatively elevated share of imported cars stateside (like General MotorsGM $47.32 (-7.36%)) doing far worse than those with more final assembly completed domestically (like FordF $10.03 (-3.79%)). Some automakers with elevated domestic production and less exposure to imported parts, like RivianRIVN $13.05 (7.56%) and TeslaTSLA $272.80 (0.43%), even benefited from their rivals’ woes. And rental car companies HertzHTZ $4.31 (22.03%) and AvisCAR $74.30 (20.50%) boomed on the presumption that tariffs would hit auto production or raise prices (perhaps both!), lifting demand for rental cars that can be resold by these firms.
Airlines like American AirlinesAAL $11.17 (-2.67%), DeltaDAL $46.22 (-4.01%), and United AirlinesUAL $73.64 (-5.60%) all hit the skids amid fresh data showing a precipitous drop-off in cross-border flight bookings between Canada and the US.
GameStopGME $22.98 (-22.13%) had its worst day since the June livestream hosted by Keith Gill (aka Roaring Kitty) after investors reacted poorly to its convertible note issuance, either facing massive dilution or a destruction in the option value that was assigned to its massive cash pile.
Meanwhile, Dollar TreeDLTR $77.25 (11.21%)’s divestment of Family Dollar continues to be enthusiastically well received by traders, with the stock up double digits to be the S&P 500’s best performer on the day.
SoFi TechnologiesSOFI $12.22 (-6.69%), a stock beloved by retail traders as of late, slumped.
AMDAMD $106.40 (-3.22%) was a laggard in the semi space after Jefferies flagged a widening performance gap between it and Nvidia.

Petco shares go off leash, surge more than 25% after earnings beat expectationsWith the economy on shaky footing, maybe investors are hedging by purchasing pet goldfish. Shares of PetcoWOOF $3.16 (31.56%) are up more than 28% Thursday, following the brick-and-mortar pet store chain’s earnings report after the bell on Wednesday.
Investor excitement isn’t just about pet owner demand for uncomfortable photos of their dog with the Easter Bunny: Petco’s full year-earnings outlook of between $375 million and $390 million exceeded Wall Street’s expectations of $367 million.
Petco Surges as New CEO’s Store Closures Boosts Profitability
The chain, which hired a new CEO over the summer, said it will close 30 unprofitable stores this year — adding to last year’s count of 25 closures. As it sheds low-performing locations, Petco is boosting its e-commerce biz: the company announced a partnership with Uber EatsUBER $74.99 (0.93%) on Thursday, bringing all of its US locations to the delivery app.
Rival ChewyCHWY $32.58 (-1.62%) also topped estimates when it reported this week, reaching $3.23 billion in revenue (easily outselling Petco, which scored $1.55 billion).

Rivian’s made-in-the-USA production strategy is offering shelter from the auto stock sell-offAs most major global automakers tumble under the weight of new US tariffs, RivianRIVN $13.05 (7.56%) is riding high.
Shares of the electric vehicle maker are up more than 6% on Thursday because the stated goal of these tariffs — to boost American auto production for national security concerns — is something that Rivian’s already done. Its output comes from a plant in Normal, Illinois, with plans to build another manufacturing facility in Georgia next year.
Goldman Sachs analyst Mark Delaney suggested that companies like Rivian and TeslaTSLA $272.80 (0.43%), which domestically manufacture the cars they sell in the US, would be less impacted by the levies. They might face challenges from increased taxes on imported parts, but they’ll avoid any pain when it comes to assembled vehicles, in contrast to other leading automakers.

The Italian carmaker said Thursday that it will keep prices flat for three models: the Ferrari 296, SF90, and Roma. All other models ordered after April 2 will be subject to the price hike. President Trump’s 25% tariffs on foreign vehicles are set to start April 3.
The tariffs threaten European luxury car brands, which count on the US for a large chunk of their sales. Germany, home to PorschePOAHY $3.88 (-2.02%) and Mercedes-BenzMBGYY $15.19 (-1.36%), exports more cars to the US than any other European country.
Shares of Ferrari were recently up 2%

The tariff back-and-forth between the US and Canada has tanked air travel between the two countries. According to aviation analytics firm OAG, cross-border passenger bookings for US-Canada flights between April and September are down between 71% and 76% from last year.
Peak travel season, July through August, is seeing the biggest drop. In all, airlines have shed about 320,000 ticketed US-Canada seats through October. Shares of the big four airlines — DeltaDAL $46.22 (-4.01%), American AirlinesAAL $11.17 (-2.67%), United AirlinesUAL $73.64 (-5.60%), and SouthwestLUV $33.90 (-1.35%) — are all down Thursday.
More than 20 million Canadians visited the US last year, the top source of international visitors. Tariffs could hurt the Canadian dollar and make travel to the US more expensive for Canadians — and a 10% decline in Canadian travel could result in $2.1 billion in lost spending, according to the US Travel Association.

Why copying Strategy’s playbook isn’t working for GameStop
Buying bitcoin is an arbitrage play for Strategy that lets management take advantage of the elevated valuation of its shares. For GameStop, it’s something that puts the source of its premium valuation at risk.

Why Trump’s auto tariffs are crushing GM but not TeslaPresident Trump announced plans to smack imported cars and car parts with a 25% tariff on April 3, and investors once again do not like it.
Understandably, auto stock performance is revealing which carmakers’ US sales rely more on imports: GMGM $47.32 (-7.36%) was down as much as 8% Thursday, compared to Ford’sF $10.03 (-3.79%) 4% fall.
Elon Musk Is One of the Few Winners From Trump’s Car Tariffs
The discrepancy is likely due to the fact that about half of GM’s US sales (46%) are imports, compared to just a fifth (21%) for Ford. On the other hand, TeslaTSLA $272.80 (0.43%) manufactures its vehicles entirely in the US and only imports 20% to 25% of its parts from Mexico. Its shares are up over 5% as of 11:20 a.m. Thursday.
Tariffs are widely expected to send auto costs surging for US consumers (up to $12,200 for some vehicles). The United Auto Workers have praised the levies, saying they could bring thousands of manufacturing jobs back to the US.

That valuation is down from the $340 billion The Wall Street Journal had originally reported back in January. It’s still nearly double its $157 billion valuation from a funding round in October.
SoftBank’s stock is down 2.6% premarket as investors consider the company’s huge capital outlay and as AI companies take a beating.

Welcome to the Robinhood Merch store. Our store used to be for Robinhoodies only, but that’s not very inclusive of us so we’ve made our store public to democratize merch for all! We’re proud to create apparel and accessories that reflect our belief that not only is finance for everyone, so is this merch.

Environmental, Social & Governance at Robinhood
Our ESG Priorities
Robinhood was founded on the belief that everyone should be welcome to participate in our financial system. Our Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) program aims to help build a company our customers can be proud to invest with. We see ESG as an opportunity to drive long-term, positive impact for our business. By providing our customers with more transparency on our priorities and how we operate, we can harness a new generation of investors who desire to support companies that reflect their values. We were proud to launch our first ESG report within two months of becoming a public company, and we publish our ESG report annually as we continue to provide our stakeholders with transparent disclosure.
