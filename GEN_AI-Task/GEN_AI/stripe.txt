How it works
Power payments and payouts
Instantly onboard service providers
Onboard drivers, sellers, or other vendors for payments and payouts with just a few questions, and instantly link their bank accounts for payouts. Stripe Connect helps collect and verify information to meet payments KYC and compliance requirements.
Optimise checkout and beat fraud
Launch a conversion optimised checkout flow from day 1. Stripe supports 135+ currencies and dozens of global payment methods. Fraud prevention is also built into Stripe – our machine learning models are trained daily on data from millions of global businesses to protect your marketplace.
Send payouts flexibly and quickly
Customise payout schedules or provide the option to receive payouts on a rolling basis. You can also offer instant payouts, allowing service providers to deposit earnings to their bank account in minutes.

Manage your marketplace
Centralise your marketplace operations
Stripe can replace multiple systems typically used to manage payments, payouts, and service providers. Give your finance, operations, and support teams the tools they need to control funds, handle refunds, manage expenses and more.
Control your flow of funds
Split transactions to pay out multiple recipients from a single payment. Marketplaces in the US can also top up their account balance to add bonuses or send one-off payouts.
Handle refunds and disputes
Easily handle refunds and disputes via the Stripe Dashboard or API. Responding quickly to customers and effectively submitting evidence can help you keep losses at a minimum.
Programmatically control expenses
Generate and distribute physical or virtual spend cards with custom controls that can be configured to specific purchase locations, dollar amounts, and use limits.
Manage service providers
Use the Stripe Dashboard to create, manage, and update provider accounts. In the US, Stripe also provides gross earnings tracking and generates 1099s.
Differentiate your marketplace
Grow your marketplace with subscriptions and financial services
Stripe’s products work together and make it easy to expand your offerings with minimal engineering investment. Give service providers access to Stripe’s entire suite of features. You can help them manage cash flow with instant payouts and flexible financing or support subscription plans and loyalty programs in your marketplace.

Case studies
GitHub works with Stripe to add a donations programme
GitHub is a code management platform that sought a partner to help them launch a donations programme to support open-source developers.
Challenge
GitHub Sponsors allows the developer community to financially support the people around the world who design, build, and maintain the open-source projects they depend on, directly on GitHub.
Solution
GitHub used Stripe to onboard developers in 34 countries to accept donations. In two months, Stripe helped Github reduce a manual 9-step, week-long process to a fully localised, 2-minute onboarding experience. They also expanded support to more countries and currencies without additional work.

SkipTheDishes works with Stripe to maximise revenue
SkipTheDishes, Canada’s leading food delivery service, wanted to maximise revenue while keeping fraud at a minimum.
Challenge
SkipTheDishes wanted to reduce fraud while providing customers with a smooth checkout experience. They were looking to modernise their technology stack within an ambitious go-live timeline and wanted to eliminate system downtimes with a new payments partner.
Solution
In just three months, SkipTheDishes successfully moved all of their volume to Stripe. With the transition, they saw a 6% uplift in payment processing approval rates. They’ve also been able to significantly decrease fraud rates and have reduced chargeback costs by over 30%.

Since moving over to Stripe, our payment processing approval rates have picked up by 6% in a very short period of time, which is a huge win on improving our conversion rates with customers and our reputation with issuers.

Instacart works with Stripe to handle multi-party payments
Instacart delivers groceries from local stores directly to customers. They needed a partner to help them manage their flow of funds efficiently.
Challenge
Instacart offers a multi-sided marketplace and has complex payment needs. Since they accept payments directly from consumers and manage payouts for both grocery stores, shoppers, and delivery partners, they needed a way to streamline payments and payouts across multiple parties.
Solution
With Stripe, Instacart was able to build a high-conversion checkout flow for consumers, and create a compliant onboarding experience for both grocery stores and shoppers. To help attract more shoppers to their platform, they also launched Instant Cashout in partnership with Stripe, a feature that enables shoppers to cash out earnings immediately.

Catawiki works with Stripe to simplify compliance
Catawiki is a fast growing online auction platform. They needed a partner to help keep them compliant with constantly changing global regulations.
Challenge
As Catawiki entered new markets, they were challenged with new regulations, and a myriad KYC and onboarding requirement – and an overstretched engineering team.
Solution
Partnering with Stripe allowed Catawiki’s developers to increase their engineering efficiency and global scale while minimising the time they needed to spend on code to comply with local regulations.

Use cases
Build better products and processes with financial data
Secure access to users’ financial data enables you to streamline common processes, such as onboarding and payments, and build new products to help users manage their finances. Because Financial Connections is fully interoperable with the rest of Stripe, it’s easy to connect to users’ accounts to improve payments and product experiences.
Streamline payments and payouts
Power secure and reliable ACH Direct Debit payments, payouts, and other types of money movement by instantly verifying bank accounts. Check account balances before initiating debits to avoid payment failures and insufficient funds errors.

Stripe’s products make it easy for creators to earn more revenue on your platform with minimal engineering, legal, and compliance investment.

Case studies
X partners with Stripe to help creators earn additional income
X is a leading social platform that brings people together to have conversations about what’s happening around the world. Its goal is to help creators to earn money from the content they create online.
Challenge
X wanted to offer new ways for creators to earn money on their platform, but needed a fast and compliant way to process and split payments, and pay out globally.
Solution
With Stripe Connect, X was able to shift payments compliance requirements to Stripe while focusing on building new creator monetisation products on its platform. Stripe’s flexible APIs helped X launch Ticketed Spaces and Super Follows, where creators can earn money by creating an extra level of conversation for their closest followers, and use Stripe to access their funds and manage their earnings – all in one place.

Increase trust & safety
Reduce the number of scammers and bad actors to increase the credibility of your marketplace or community.
Reduce fraud losses
Help your risk teams securely collect identity information to determine if a user is legitimate or fraudulent.
Streamline KYC
Make it easy for users to prove their identity at onboarding while fulfilling a crucial part of your compliance requirements.
Prevent account takeovers
Add a layer of security before allowing high-risk features or if you notice suspicious activities in an account.
How it works
Confirm identities with confidence
Stripe Identity is built on top of technology that Stripe uses to verify millions of global users. It's a part of our own global Know Your Customer (KYC) process, risk operations, and more.
Verify global users
Fragmented government ID standards make it challenging to verify identities for global users. With Stripe Identity, you can confidently verify the authenticity of ID documents from over 100 countries.
Capture IDs with a conversion-optimised verification flow
Retrieve extracted data from documents
Access collected images of ID documents and selfies
Maximise conversion
Poor image capture is the most common reason legitimate users are mistakenly rejected. Stripe Identity guides users through photo-taking and automatically scores each frame to select the most readable image, maximising success rates.
Try it out 
Move your ID document into this area
Detect fraudulent users
Stripe Identity is built on the same technology we use to defend against attacks on our own global network. We’ve optimised our fraud prevention system with learnings from over a decade of experience fending off sophisticated fraudsters, and we are constantly updating our models to prevent the latest attack vectors.
Detect fake IDs and spoofed photos with machine learning
Match the ID photo with selfies of the document holder
Validate SSN and addresses against global databases
Fully integrated
Built on the Stripe network
By centralising ID verification with core business operations such as payments, subscriptions and payouts, your engineering team can save time on integration, and your operational team can spend less time hopping between systems.
Fight fraud with multi-layered verifications
Once Stripe Identity confirms a user’s identity, Financial Connections can verify the user owns a linked bank account to reduce the risk of account takeovers.
Customise verifications on your platform
Embed ID verification using our pre-built libraries and SDKs. Platforms and marketplaces can configure Connect Onboarding to collect additional verifications based on their own risk signals.
We decided to build the Verified Bot programme on Stripe Identity for 3 reasons: the user experience was seamless, integration was easier since we’re already using Stripe for payments, and our users trusted Stripe to help keep their identity information safe and secure.
Mason Sciotti, Product Manager for Dev Ecosystem, Discord
We were able to easily update our existing Connect onboarding experience to collect additional verifications using Stripe Identity. This allows us to control payouts based on verification status to reduce fraud, while keeping our hosts on a single, consistent experience that’s powered by Stripe.
Matt Bendett, VP Operations, Peerspace
Stripe Identity helps our fraud team avoid hours of manual labour and reduces the risk of exposing sensitive user data. The entire verification process is now much faster and easier for legitimate users.
Simon Kreuz, Co-founder, Shippo
With Stripe Identity, we were able to build a progressive verification experience. We start with an ID number check, and if that fails we automatically ask for an ID document. This lets us keep our community safe without adding unnecessary friction.
Andrea Barrett, Co-founder, UrbanSitter
Keep user data safe
Security and privacy at the core
Stripe Identity is based on expertise we’ve developed from building a global infrastructure that handles hundreds of billions of dollars in payments annually. Our systems are designed to collect consent and with privacy top of mind.
Isolate sensitive data
Stripe reduces compliance burdens by storing verification data on behalf of your business so it never touches your systems.
Programmatically delete user data
Limit sensitive data access with restricted API keys
Access pre-built privacy FAQ templates
Provide transparency for users
Stripe gives users control over who their data is shared with and provides answers to common questions on how their data is protected.
Users explicitly give consent before sharing data
Users can easily manage, retrieve and delete data
Users have access to clear and transparent FAQs

Why Stripe
Optimise revenue with the power of the Stripe platform
Offer a local experience in every market
Stripe supports 135+ currencies and dozens of global payment methods such as Apple Pay, ACH, BACS, iDEAL, and SEPA Direct Debit that can help increase conversion by as much as 50%. We also help you navigate tax and handle regulatory requirements like SCA by triggering 3D. Secure authentication when required.
Reduce churn with revenue recovery tools
Nearly a quarter of churn is involuntary. Stripe’s dunning tools help businesses recover 41% of failed recurring payments on average. Businesses using our smart retries recover 14% more revenue than those retrying failed payments on a set schedule.
Simplify accrual accounting with automated revenue reporting
Automate and configure revenue recognition so you can close your books quickly and accurately. Revenue Recognition effortlessly handles even the most complex scenarios – upgrades, downgrades, prorations, refunds, and disputes.
Streamline and optimise your business
Use Stripe’s revenue and finance automation tools to drive growth, reduce costs, and increase efficiency. A tight integration between billing, payments, tax, revenue reporting, and data helps you recover more revenue, spend less on compliance, and speed up payments.
Grow your SaaS business with Stripe
In this brief demo video, learn how to unify your payments, billing, and revenue management to streamline SaaS subscriptions and capture more revenue.

Case studies
Slack uses Stripe to automate payments & billing
Slack is a channel-based messaging platform that needed help automating custom billing schedules and allowing customers to update their own plans.
Challenge
To meet rapidly growing demand, Slack expanded to serve more global customers and large-scale enterprises. Among other challenges, Slack needed to support a variety of payment methods in different regions, set up automation for a custom, usage-based invoicing system, and let customers adjust their own plans.
Solution
In just 2 weeks, Slack worked with Stripe to launch a new system that automated all their billing and payment collection needs across 15 countries. It dramatically reduced engineering time spent on maintaining an in-house system and helped their operational team spend less time responding to custom pricing requests.

Having a billing system that lets you stay nimble to respond to customers' needs is really critical. Stripe gives you that flexibility.

Twilio partnered with Stripe to increase revenue
Twilio is a communication platform that needed a partner to help them improve global payments performance to increase conversion and revenue.
Challenge
As Twilio expanded globally, they needed a payment processor equipped to handle international transactions at scale with high authorisation rates to maximise revenue uplift, reduce issuer declines, and reduce involuntary churn.
Solution
Twilio ran an A/B test with multiple major global payment processors monitoring authorisation rates across card networks. After weeks of testing, they saw a 10% uplift overall in authorisation rates from working with Stripe.

Typeform uses Stripe to launch flexible pricing plans
Typeform is a form builder that wanted to quickly launch new pricing as they developed new products, entered new markets, and closed custom deals.
Challenge
Typeform needed to implement a global billing system that would allow charging monthly and annual subscription fees.
Solution
Typeform rebuilt their billing system on Stripe, which let them launch a new set of subscription plans – billed monthly or annually. They can now automate customer upgrades, send recurring invoices, collect payments in multiple currencies, and handle financial reporting without manual intervention.

WeTransfer migrated to Stripe to scale faster
WeTransfer is a file transfer service that needed a partner to help them scale billing and payments as they grew in size and complexity.
Challenge
WeTransfer was growing out of their homegrown billing and payments system which only supported two pricing plans and two currencies.
Solution
Instead of continuing to refactor their in-house system, WeTransfer migrated to Stripe to increase billing flexibility as they scaled. With Stripe, they launched new pricing plans, supported new global payment methods, automated payments collection, and added fraud detection.

Simplify operations
Manage invoices and view detailed reports directly from the Dashboard. It’s easy to update, void, duplicate, refund, or mark invoices as paid outside Stripe. Automate accounts receivable processes and reduce time spent tracking and collecting invoice payments. Enable your customers to self-manage their invoices and subscriptions from a secure, prebuilt customer portal. You can also streamline related revenue and reconciliation workflows with our revenue and finance automation tools.
For finance teams
A toolkit for accounts receivable automation
Stripe’s advanced invoicing features can help your finance and operational teams save time with previously manual workflows like payment reconciliation and invoice collections.
Create an account 
A more efficient way to accept wire transfers and ACH
Many businesses prefer to pay large invoices via wire or ACH, but this can require tedious and manual accounts receivable efforts. Bank account setup can also be error-prone for your customers. Stripe Invoicing automates how businesses support B2B payment methods.
Collect invoices via secure and reliable ACH Direct Debit payments. Get paid faster and minimize transaction failures by enabling customers to instantly link their bank accounts through Stripe Financial Connections.
Automate reconciliation
For ACH Credit payments, Stripe generates virtual bank account numbers to keep your company’s banking details private and automatically reconciles incoming payments with outstanding invoices.

Stripe Apps
Extend Stripe with third party services or embed custom user experiences directly in the Stripe Dashboard.
LOOKING FOR THE STRIPE DASHBOARD MOBILE APP?
Use the Stripe Dashboard mobile app to view business metrics, track and manage your operations, and perform payments activity like accepting Tap to Pay, or creating payment links, basic invoices, and subscriptions.
Stripe Apps provides the opportunity to become a third-party developer for Stripe. You can develop and privately distribute or publish your Stripe app on the global Stripe Apps Marketplace. As a third-party Stripe Apps developer, you can create apps to:
Authenticate users for third-party services using OAuth 2.0 or a restricted API key (RAK).
Use the Stripe API to make calls, listen to events, and automate workflows. For example, you can create an app that automatically initiates a billing flow when a customer signs a contract, to streamline tasks and reducing manual account reconciliation.
Design custom user interfaces that operate directly within the Stripe Dashboard. For example, users can interact with customer records, balance statements, and payment information in their CRM systems.
Note

Scaling our products means giving our users flexible subscription options. With Stripe Billing, we quickly rolled out monthly pay-as-you-go options for ChatGPT and our API, respectively.
Patricia Lue, Head of Revenue Accounting & Operations

Retention
From one-time order to lifetime customer
Automate every part of recurring relationships – from managing customer events to retrying failed payments at the ideal time.
Reduce involuntary churn
Nearly a quarter of churn is involuntary – it’s caused by missed payments or declined cards. Stripe’s recovery tools help businesses recover 57% of failed recurring payments on average, and businesses using our Smart Retries recover 11% more revenue than those retrying failed payments on a set schedule. Stripe’s recovery tools helped our users recover $3.42 billion in revenue last year.
For involuntary churn, we have found that Stripe Smart Retries have really worked for us. They’re built into Stripe Billing and use machine learning to retry cards at the optimal time. We’ve recovered millions of dollars in revenue that we would have otherwise lost – this is very substantial for us as a subscription business.
Nadia Ali, CFO, Midjourney
Smart Retries
Stripe uses machine learning to choose optimal times to retry failed payments which may increase the chance of success. 90% of the cards used on the Stripe network have been seen more than once.
Automatic reminders and one-click updates
Enable automated emails for failed or overdue payments. Plus give your customers a secure, one-click option for updating their payment method in the hosted recovery page.
Automatic card updater
Stripe works directly with card networks (where available) to update payment details when a card expires or is replaced.
Recovery analytics
Monitor and analyse subscription payment failures and recovery rates, measure the effectiveness of all recovery efforts in a single view, and investigate trends using downloadable reports directly from the Dashboard.
Optimise the customer lifecycle
Use Stripe as a system of record for the customer lifecycle: manage important events such as automatically provisioning services for new subscribers or sending reminders for renewals. You can also enable your customers to self-manage their subscriptions with the customer portal.
Webhooks
Automatically notify other systems of lifecycle events, including new subscriptions, payments and cancellations.
Billing proration
Stripe automatically prorates billing when any plan changes occur.
Renewal rules
Configure rules to automatically or manually renew customers’ subscriptions.
Customer portal
Allow your customers to self-manage their subscriptions by sharing a link to a secure, pre-built customer portal.

Build vs. buy
Building your own subscription and billing management software requires significant investment, and it’s flat-out difficult to get right.
Businesses often cobble something together to support an initial launch, but underestimate the complexity and costs down the line. A homegrown solution needs to be continuously maintained to support new product launches, business models, pricing experiments, global expansion, changes in regulatory requirements, and a host of other challenges as business grows. Learn why 55% of recurring revenue businesses are likely to get a new billing system by Q1 2025.
Stripe Billing offers the functionality you need to quickly get started today, but with the flexibility and features to support you at scale, so you can focus on building your business.

Ford CEO Jim Farley made it clear when he took over the top spot at the vehicle manufacturer in October 2020 that one of his biggest focuses would be on connected vehicle services.
Solution
Ford will use Connect to facilitate a customer’s payments to a correct local Ford or Lincoln dealer. As Ford develops e-commerce offerings across the product and service spectrum, Stripe’s platform and services are expected to drive new efficiency into processing of e-commerce payments, such as vehicle ordering, reservations and digital and charging services.

Payments
Stripe has developed strong expertise in user experiences that will help provide easy, intuitive and secure payment processes for our customers.

WooCommerce partners with Stripe to launch in 17 new countries in 3 months
As one of the most popular e-commerce platforms in the world, WooCommerce enables WordPress businesses to sell and manage orders directly from their websites.
Challenge
WooCommerce wanted to help its merchants adapt quickly to changing consumer habits through its own integrated payments solutions.
Solution
WooCommerce decided to launch a brand new platform, WooCommerce Payments, by integrating several different Stripe products to enable merchants to do everything from taking contactless payments and accessing funds in real time to tapping into business funding to keep operations afloat. In just three months and with a team of fewer than 20 people, the company partnered with Stripe to launch WooCommerce Payments in 17 countries – from Canada to New Zealand and across Europe.

Payments
Building on Stripe, we started with payments, billing and subscriptions. But we’re quickly adding Stripe Terminal for in-person payments, and planning to offer a full suite of fintech services to help our merchants grow their business, including access to capital and more – not only in the US, but also Europe and other regions where WooCommerce thrives. We chose Stripe because its extensive options across payments and financial services are what enable us to do this, and do it rapidly without compromise.

GitHub works with Stripe to add a donations programme
Microsoft-owned GitHub is a code management platform that was looking for a partner to help it launch Github Sponsors to support open-source developers.
Challenge
GitHub wanted to create a compliant and seamless onboarding experience that is accessible to the developer community in various languages around the world. Once onboarded, anyone on the Sponsors platform can sponsor a developer contributing to an open source project – and GitHub can match it up to $5000 per developer.
Solution
GitHub used Stripe to onboard developers in 34 countries to accept donations. In two months, Stripe helped GitHub reduce a manual 9-step, week-long process to a fully localised, 2-minute onboarding experience. It also expanded support to more countries and currencies without additional work.
Products
Connect
Payments
We are extremely happy customers, and Stripe makes it possible for us to build new products like GitHub Sponsors that would be nearly unthinkable without them.

Nasdaq chooses Stripe for robust security and scalability
Nasdaq is a global technology company democratising access to the capital markets. It owns and operates several stock exchanges across the US and Europe. Nasdaq chose Stripe for robust security and scalability.
Challenge
After making several acquisitions, Nasdaq knew it needed a payments provider that would allow it to work securely across its subsidiaries and assist in improving its recurring billing and financial reporting.
Solution
Stripe Payments allowed Nasdaq to provide simple and secure card payment options, while Stripe Billing gave the Nasdaq team a flexible way to bill their customers on a recurring basis, including accepting alternative payment methods. Nasdaq will continue to grow its software solutions with the trust of Stripe’s leading security infrastructure.
Products
Payments
Billing
Scalability and security are two key areas of focus in operating all of our solutions. That is why we chose Stripe. We saw Stripe as the most secure provider.

Adam Warne, Chief Information Officer at River Island
Getting our customers on the road quickly with exceptional service is our top priority and this partnership with Stripe is an example of how we’re leveraging advanced technology to make that possible.
Tim Langley-Hawthorne, Chief Information Officer at Hertz
We chose to work with Stripe because they offer modern readers, reliable payments, and a direct integration to Cegid. The integration process was fast and easy. Switching to Stripe has greatly reduced friction for both our customers and sales representatives.
José Fernando Arango Jiménez, IT Director at Tennis

Case studies
Dripos unifies commerce with Stripe Terminal and Stripe Reader S700
Dripos powers more than 100,000 coffee shops and cafés in the United States.
Challenge
Coffee shop owners who use Dripos, such as Revolución, want to offer their customers seamless experiences – whether they’re ordering at the counter, at a table, or at a pop-up event.
Solution
Stripe Reader S700 allowed users to run a custom POS app such as Dripos directly on the device.
Impact
“Now we can put all the things we have – including our loyalty program, receipts, and tipping – onto the reader. It’s basically like the register unit, but on the go,” said Avery Durrant, co-founder and co-CEO at Dripos.
SQUIRE uses Tap to Pay so barbers can start accepting in-person payments in minutes
SQUIRE is an all-in-one, easy-to-use business-management system for barbers.
Challenge
With transactions continuing to move away from cash toward cards and mobile payments, SQUIRE needed a way to provide alternative payment methods.
Solution
SQUIRE added Tap to Pay and the Stripe Terminal SDK to let barbers accept contactless in-person payments, using only a compatible smartphone or tablet.
Impact
With Tap to Pay, barbers can process payments right on the devices they’re already using to run their businesses.
Dines generates 150% jump in revenue per venue, with Stripe Terminal
Dines is an all-in-one platform for hospitality businesses across the UK.
Challenge
Dines realised that businesses using third-party systems for in-person ordering were experiencing a host of challenges, such as longer wait times for orders and more customer complaints.
Solution
Dines believed the best way to streamline operations and reduce the workload for operators was to process all payments through one service.
Impact
After introducing Stripe Terminal, Dines has seen a 150% increase in revenue per venue and is on track to achieve 4x year-over-year growth in transaction volumes.
atVenu streamlines merchandise sales at live events with Stripe
atVenu is one of the world’s leading live-events platforms.
Challenge
atVenu found that its existing hardware did not work well in the kinds of temporary and transient environments its vendors often found themselves in.
Solution
Stripe Terminal offered a reliable way to make in-person card and contactless payments as smooth as possible in venues that may not have a roof, let alone a stable internet connection.
Impact
“The API can definitely handle the scope of our business,” said Derek Ball, atVenu’s co-founder and CEO. “In one night we’ll process over $10 million of volume through Stripe, without a hiccup.”

Effortless address collection
Use the Address Element to collect and validate addresses for billing, shipping, and more. It can help you reduce the risk of shipping goods to the wrong location, and more accurately apply the right sales taxes.

We migrated to Stripe Elements in less than a day with a single developer. Since then, we’ve seen a 6% increase in conversion at checkout.
Liam Mclaney, Co-founder, OnJam
With Stripe Elements, we were able to instantly turn on iDEAL, Bancontact, EPS, and Giropay. As we rapidly enter new markets, it’s important that we’re able to scale new payment methods without being limited by engineering bandwidth.
Lindsay Simon, Chief Valuations Officer, ValueMyStuff
We wanted the checkout experience to feel cohesive with the rest of our product, but didn’t want to recreate payments from scratch. Stripe Elements made it super simple to achieve this.
Bridger Maxwell, Co-founder, Scribble
Integrating with Stripe Elements was surprisingly easy. Having Stripe handle localisation, formatting, and automatically displaying relevant local payment methods has made the user experience much better for our global customer base.
Dhiraj Nayak, CTO, 3D Usher
Less code, fewer errors
Don’t waste time reinventing the payments wheel
Building a conversion-optimised payments experience is hard. Elements lets you take advantage of Stripe’s collective experience across front-end, design, and analytics, so that you can spend less time on payments and more time on your product.

How we built instant payouts with Lyft
Challenge
Lyft’s biggest request from drivers was the ability to get paid more frequently compared to traditional weekly payouts, which meant Lyft needed to find a way to seamlessly pay out drivers at their convenience.
Solution
Lyft worked with Stripe to build Express Pay, providing drivers the ability to decide when they want to get paid out – typically within a few hours of a journey.

How we built multi-party payments with Instacart
Challenge
Instacart facilitates a multi-sided marketplace with complex payment needs. Instacart needed a way to streamline payments and payouts across consumers, grocery stores, shoppers and delivery partners.
Solution
Stripe enabled all aspects of Instacart’s intricate payments infrastructure to function at scale, making it easy for customers to pay the way they want, and using features such as Instant Checkout to speed up payouts to shoppers and retailers.

How we built embedded finance with Shopify
Challenge
Dealing with banking and financial services is an essential part of running a business, yet most of today’s banking services aren’t designed for the needs of Shopify’s independent business owners.
Solution
Shopify built Shopify Balance using Stripe Treasury to offer Shopify merchants a fast, simple and integrated way to obtain critical financial products and oversee their finances – all within Shopify.

Issuing
Stripe Treasury gives us the flexibility to customise Shopify Balance specifically for our merchants. By building across Stripe’s payments and banking infrastructure, we’ve been able to give Shopify merchants access to critical financial products that meet their needs, such as faster access to funds and rewards, helping them further grow their businesses.
Tui Allen, Senior Lead of Banking Services
How we launched Stripe Climate with Flexport
Challenge
To prevent the most catastrophic effects of climate change, we need to radically reduce the new emissions we put into the air, and develop new carbon removal technologies to remove carbon already in the atmosphere.
Solution
Stripe partnered with forward-thinking businesses such as Flexport to launch Stripe Climate, which makes it easy for businesses to contribute a fraction of revenue to fund frontier carbon removal technology. So far, more than two thousand businesses have purchased frontier carbon removal with Stripe Climate.

Customers by solution
We obsess over payments so our customers don’t have to
Our teams agonise over the right functionality so that we can offer a powerful platform without requiring you to spend months to integrate payments capabilities.
That means more time to focus on your core product and customer experience and less time stitching together disparate systems or handling edge cases.

Accrual accounting doesn’t have to be complex
As your business grows, accounting for revenue can quickly become tedious and error-prone. We built a revenue recognition solution into Stripe, so you can automate accrual accounting for your transactions and billing terms.
Stripe Revenue Recognition effortlessly handles even the most complex scenarios – upgrades, downgrades, prorations, refunds, and disputes. With accurate data, you can prepare audit-ready financial statements and gain a comprehensive view of your business.
What’s included
Better insights into your business performance
A single picture of all your revenue
Automatically view all your Stripe transactions and terms, and import non-Stripe data from the Dashboard.
Automated revenue reports and dashboards
Generate accounting reports that are ready out of the box. No need to dedicate engineering resources.
Configurable for your business
Create and automate custom rules to recognise revenue in line with your accounting practices. Customise your chart of accounts for streamlined mapping to your general ledger.
Audit in real time
Prepare for audits by tracing any revenue amount down to the underlying customers and transactions.
A single picture of all your revenue
Gain a complete view of all your revenue – no matter how you earned it. With Revenue Recognition, you can include the subscriptions, invoices, and payment transactions already stored in Stripe.
You can import non-Stripe revenue, fulfilment schedules, contracts (through Stripe’s Salesforce CPQ connector), and service terms to consolidate all your revenue data in one place.
Automated revenue reports and dashboards
Instantly review detailed tables, charts, and journal entries following ASC 606 and IFRS 15 standards to get a snapshot of your business.

We’re moving everything to Stripe, so all of this complex work will disappear. Before Stripe, closing our books meant checking each contract manually and pasting them into an Excel file with a very complicated formula. We can’t be done with that soon enough.
Arianna Cesareo, Accountant, Productboard
Automatically recognising revenue with Stripe gives me peace of mind because the data is accurate. Stripe does all the calculations of deferred revenue, plus I can use transaction overrides to make historical updates.
Scott Pielsticker, Founder & CEO, ContactMonkey
I can’t emphasise enough how important it is that Stripe offers a revenue recognition product built-in. It saves us days at our monthly close and frees up our accounting teams to focus on more value-added activities.
Chris Carvalho, Controller, LogRocket
We need to reconcile all kinds of payments – monthly, up-front, and even per container. There’s no room for error as we need to be GAAP compliant. With Stripe, revenue recognition is built in and automated.

Use ML that actually works
Radar detects and blocks fraud using machine learning that trains on data across millions of global companies.
Stop blocking legitimate customers
Old ways of combating fraud were never designed for modern internet businesses and can lead to lower acceptance rates and lost revenue. Radar helps you distinguish fraudsters from customers and apply Dynamic 3D Secure to high-risk payments.
Get protection that adapts to you
Our machine learning infrastructure lets us retrain models – including ones customised for your business – every day. Radar’s algorithms quickly adapt to shifting fraud patterns and to your unique business.
No integration required
Radar is built into Stripe – get started from day one with zero code. And it’s seamlessly integrated with other products, like Checkout, so you can access the full Stripe platform.
Radar
Trained with hundreds of billions of data points
Stripe processes payments from 197 countries for every industry, company size, and business model. Even if a card is new to your business, there’s a 91% chance it’s been seen before on the Stripe network.
Strength in numbers
By learning from millions of global businesses processing billions in payments each year, Radar can assign risk scores to every payment and automatically block many high-risk payments.
Better ML outcomes with Stripe-scale data
Radar scans every payment using thousands of signals from across the Stripe network to help detect and prevent fraud – even before it hits your business.
More accurate than third-party tools
Radar ingests data from every layer of the financial stack, integrating checkout flow data, rich payments data, and card network and bank information to assess fraud risk.
Data from financial partners
Stripe’s partnerships with Visa, Mastercard, American Express, and leading banks let us use data like TC40s, SAFE reports, and early dispute notifications to help identify fraudulent charges before they’re disputed.
Data from payments
Radar is fully integrated with the rest of Stripe, so our systems can instantly use rich payment information – such as customer details, shipping and billing addresses, and other properties – to improve machine learning performance.
Data from checkout flows
Stripe’s checkout tools automatically incorporate certain buyer patterns from your website and mobile app to help detect anomalous payments. Radar uses these signals to map a comprehensive customer path that can accurately predict fraud.
Sophisticated signals engineered for impact
Radar is built for global internet businesses facing evolving fraud threats. Radar constantly tweaks our algorithms, tests which attributes are most relevant, and generates compound signals to help precisely identify and block fraud.
Device fingerprints
Tie multiple signals into a single device profile.
Historical snapshots
Spot recurring patterns across years of historical data.
Proxy detection
Identify IP spoofing and proxy usage.
Cumulative impact
Radar scores every transaction by combining multiple signals to help determine whether a payment is fraudulent.
Smarter fraud protection with machine learning
Effective systems should identify fraud without blocking legitimate payments. Read our primer on how machine learning can produce predictive models of fraud from large sets of data.

Case study
Shopify uses Stripe Treasury to power Shopify Balance
Shopify is a leading global commerce company, providing trusted tools to start, grow, market, and manage a retail business of any size. With Shopify Balance, merchants get a one-stop-shop to manage their funds, pay bills, and track expenses. This gives them easier access to financial products and greater control over their finances.
Challenge
Dealing with banking and financial services is an essential part of running a business, yet most of today’s banking services aren’t designed for the needs of independent business owners.
Solution
Shopify Balance offers Shopify merchants a fast, simple, and integrated way to manage their funds. Built on Stripe Treasury, Shopify Balance enables merchants to obtain critical financial products and oversee their finances – all within Shopify.

Showcase your app
You can build an app for your team or share it with all Stripe users on the Stripe App Marketplace, where it’ll be discoverable by any Stripe user.
Build an app
Build Stripe Apps for every use case, for every business
You can build apps for all of your core business functions, including accounting, analytics, sales, and marketing. An app can be just for your team or listed in the App Marketplace for any Stripe user.
Simplify workflows
Apps can streamline your most common workflows by triggering actions inside or outside Stripe. Use the Stripe API to initiate billing, issue refunds, upgrade subscription plans, and more.
Share context across systems
Give users confidence that their important data is always in sync. You can build an app to bring data from Stripe into your product inventory, marketing tool or helpdesk. Or you can deep link from the Dashboard into your CRM or accounting software for easier reconciliation.
Visualise information
Your app can bring together data from Stripe and other systems, and then visualize it with components that look and feel just like the Stripe Dashboard. Your app can also link Stripe with your custom reporting tool to generate reports that help you spot trends and increase revenue.

Get discovered by any business using Stripe
While you can deploy an app privately for your team, you can also list an app on the Stripe App Marketplace, where anyone with a Stripe account can install it.
Reach more than one million Stripe users
Creating an app for Stripe can get your product in front of new audiences. Users can install your app from the App Marketplace and use it directly in the Stripe Dashboard, in a highly visible app drawer.

Deepen engagement with your product
Apps can help your users be more productive by bringing together their important tools. By extending your product into the Stripe Dashboard–or pulling data from Stripe into your product – you can improve your user experience.

What’s possible with apps
Not sure what to build? These apps are simplifying operations for different teams.
Intercom
Xero
Mailchimp
DocuSign
SendOwl
Kyber
Intercom
Intercom’s app lets you easily check on a customer’s support history from the Stripe customer detail page. For example, a customer support agent using Stripe could see that a customer is requesting a refund through Intercom. They could issue the refund through Stripe and even use Intercom’s app to reply to the customer directly to let them know that the request has been completed.
Explore the Stripe App Marketplace
Find apps for almost any function, from sales to support.

Since their inception, Stripe and Intercom have been sharing a very similar goal: empowering every business to thrive on the internet. With the app, we hope to serve thousands of shared customers so that they can save time and get the most value out of our products.
Stan Massueras, VP of Partnerships
We built a Stripe App to provide our shared customers an intuitive, best-in-class integration between our two products. We know that customers have a lot of choice today, and providing a seamless experience across all their financial software is a priority.
Eric Glyman, Co-Founder and CEO
Agreements are critical for businesses. The DocuSign eSignature app allows Stripe users to easily link, reconcile and track DocuSign agreements and Stripe records, like payments and invoices, without using clunky, manual processes. We’re excited to partner with Stripe to provide a more streamlined and unified experience for our joint customers.
Peter Hunn, Senior Director of Smart Agreements
We built an app because we saw strong potential in making Stripe data easy to store and query with PostgreSQL. We also see the app as a potential driver of business growth, hopefully for both Render and Stripe.
Anurag Goel, Founder and CEO

Ideas for progress





Stripe partners with millions of the world’s most innovative businesses. These businesses are the result of many different inputs. Perhaps the most important ingredient is “ideas.”
Stripe Press highlights ideas that we think can be broadly useful. Some books contain entirely new material, some are collections of existing work reimagined, and others are republications of previous works that have remained relevant over time or have renewed relevance today.

Why Stripe Sigma
Get insights from your Stripe data powered by SQL and AI
Sigma empowers businesses to easily explore and analyse their Stripe data for faster business insights within the Stripe Dashboard.
Make data-driven decisions
Gain insights, track trends, and analyse patterns in your data down to the transaction level. Use SQL or natural language prompts to get instant answers to your business questions.
Fully customisable reporting
Monitor your business by creating custom metrics and reports that fit your needs. Write SQL from scratch, start with a pre-built template, or modify existing reports with the help of our AI-powered assistant. Then, easily visualise your data by transforming reports into dynamic charts.
Get insights on your schedule
Stay informed with automated report delivery straight to your inbox. Schedule your reports to be sent on a daily, weekly, or monthly basis, so you can get the answers you need exactly when you need them.
Collaborate with ease
Move faster by saving frequently run queries for easy access. Share queries directly with your teammates in Sigma, or download them as CSV files for offline analysis.

Save and share queries with your team
Save frequently-used queries to run them again at any time or share a link to a useful query so that any of your team-mates can use it too.
Stripe Sigma has helped accelerate our financial close process. Instead of manually combining multiple data sources each month, we’re now able to run a few simple queries in Sigma, enabling faster monthly reconciliation for credit card transactions.
Kelly Hofmann, Revenue Accounting
Sigma gives us legitimate evidence to challenge a chargeback, whereas before Stripe, we had no visibility whatsoever. The new level of data and insight we can get out of Stripe compared to what we could get previously is just night and day. It really helped us improve and speed up our decision-making.
Jez Bristow, Chief Product Manager
With a query that took less than 5 minutes to write, our team has been able to identify unpaid invoices and recapture tens of thousands of dollars of revenue – 8 percent of failed payments – in just two months.
Steven Moldavskiy, Business Intelligence
Before Stripe Sigma, we built our own tool to analyse our Stripe data, but it took our engineers weeks to build, required ongoing work to maintain and update, and it wasn’t always accurate. Sigma now gives all our teams accurate data without any engineering work.
Tracy Rogers, Data Scientist

Introduction to banking-as-a-service
How it works
The fastest way for your platform to become a fintech
Stripe is the most streamlined way to build financial service offerings on your platform. We handle the fundamentals – such as back-end compliance requirements, bank partner negotiations, and infrastructure – so you can focus on creating tailored experiences for your customers.
A complete suite of financial products
Stripe enables you to build the services you need without integrating multiple technology partners – whether for payments, loans, financial accounts, cards, or all of the above.
Developer-friendly APIs
We provide intuitive APIs, docs, and integration processes so that you can get started without significant upfront – or ongoing – investment or resources.
Scale and reliability
Stripe enables payments for millions of businesses – including many of the world’s biggest platforms. The same reliable infrastructure powers our BaaS offerings.
Streamlined compliance
We make it easy for you to onboard and support customers while we handle complicated back-end compliance requirements.
Case studies
Shopify uses Stripe to provide merchants with flexibility and control
Shopify is a leading global commerce company, providing trusted tools to start, grow, market, and manage a retail business of any size. With Shopify Balance, merchants can manage their funds, pay bills and track expenses. This gives them easier access to financial products and greater control over their business.
Challenge
Financial services are an essential part of running a business, but most banking services aren’t designed for the needs of independent business owners.
Solution
Shopify Balance offers Shopify merchants a fast, simple, and integrated way to manage their funds. Built on Stripe Issuing and Treasury, Shopify Balance gives users access to critical products – all within Shopify.
Products
Connect
Treasury

Payments
Issuing
By building across Stripe’s payments and banking-as-a-service infrastructure, we’ve been able to give Shopify merchants access to critical financial products that meet their needs, such as faster access to funds and rewards, helping them further grow their businesses.
Tui Allen, Senior Product Lead for Banking at Shopify
Jobber works with Stripe to launch financial services
Jobber is a field services software company that helps home service professionals streamline and automate daily operations, from scheduling jobs to invoicing customers.
Challenge
Jobber wanted to enable growth for the home service professionals on its platform by helping them get paid faster and access financing.
Solution
With Stripe, Jobber professionals are able to accept both online and in-person payments, while also getting paid in hours instead of weeks. Stripe also helps Jobber’s professionals solve cash-flow constraints by providing access to flexible financing and capital within the Jobber platform.

BloomNation uses Stripe to help independent florists achieve 40% annual growth
BloomNation is an online marketplace that enables over 3,500 florists to reach more customers with their bespoke floral designs. It allows anyone to discover and send handcrafted floral arrangements across the US, and also gives independent florists a complete platform to grow their business, including tools for marketing, payments, order management, and more.
Challenge
Founded in 2011, BloomNation was using Balanced Payments to run its marketplace payments. When that company shut down in 2015, BloomNation needed a replacement to continue powering its rapid rate of growth, and offered a speedy transition to switch over.
Solution
With Stripe Connect onboarding, BloomNation can seamlessly and instantly approve new florists for payments. With Stripe Capital, BloomNation was able to stand up an embedded lending experience for its customers in days to relieve cash constraints and help them invest in growth.

Gregg Weisstein, Founder and COO
Persona uses Stripe BaaS to build a financial platform for independent businesses
Persona is a software solution that helps professionals of all types – from fitness and wellness instructors to movers and contractors – seamlessly run their businesses’ finances.
Challenge
Persona wanted to build a platform that would make it easy for independent business owners and contractors to manage their businesses’ finances. They were looking for a partner to provide the infrastructure that would enable them to create a tailored financial offering and quickly go to market.
Solution
Stripe’s banking-as-a-service offerings (Stripe Issuing and Treasury) provided Persona with the infrastructure to build an all-in-one financial solution for its customers, with a financial account for storing funds and business cards for expenses.

Case studies
How HubSpot built a seamless payment flow for Impulse Creative
Impulse Creative is a marketing agency that helps businesses grow by using CRM providers like HubSpot to deliver the right customer experiences.
Challenge
Impulse Creative needed a way to digitise B2B payments for its coaching and training clients without the traditional “cart” experience.
Solution
HubSpot built a native payments solution, powered by Stripe, into its CRM – allowing Impulse Creative to create custom products and embed payment links into its landing pages in real time.
Impact
Impulse Creative saw a 16% uplift from visit-to-payment conversions on its landing page.
We've been astounded by the ease of setup of HubSpot's payments functionality. The ability to create custom products, streamline, and embed the payment experience into landing pages has been amazing.
Remington Begg, chief remarkable officer at Impulse Creative
Cabiri helps River Island improve authorization rates by 4%
River Island is a multi-channel fashion brand with 245 stores across the UK and a significant online presence that reaches more than 125 global markets.
Challenge
Founded in 1948, River Island was facing competition from new online retailers. It needed customer-centric, high-tech solutions for an omnichannel customer journey.
Solution
River Island engaged Cabiri, an IT consultancy, to help implement several Stripe products to replace its fragmented system, including Stripe Payments, Stripe Elements, and Stripe Terminal. Stripe now processes all self-service checkouts in River Island stores, as well as 100% of the retailer’s online sales.
Impact
River Island has seen a 4% uplift in authorisation rates and a 2% uplift in customers moving from order review to completing a transaction. Now that more customers are completing checkout and more submitted payments are being approved, River Island anticipates a boost in revenue.
Over the first 12 months of our partnership with Stripe, we will capture millions more value in sales than we previously would have.
Emily Haddrell, Digital Product Lead, River Island
How KINTO uses Nova Module to save its team 6+ hours per day
KINTO is a Japan-based producer of home and lifestyle goods dedicated to creating thoughtful objects that bring comfort and inspiration to its customers’ everyday lives.
Challenge
KINTO USA had to manually reconcile payments and invoices between Stripe and NetSuite, which was a time-consuming and inefficient process. It needed a way to streamline operations, enhance customer support, and drive growth in the US.
Solution
To seamlessly process transactions, synchronise records, and more, KINTO USA used PayPack, a no-code NetSuite solution developed by Nova Module.
Impact
With PayPack, KINTO was able to connect Stripe with NetSuite in just a few days, saving more than six hours daily in manual payment processing tasks. This improved customer satisfaction, accelerated order processing, and enabled KINTO to expand its offering of local payment methods.
We work on a prepaid model, so orders aren’t shipped until they’re paid. With PayPack and Stripe, we’ve become super efficient in sending payment links and receiving those payments. The faster we can process payments, the faster we can ship products, and the faster KINTO can grow.
Denis Dumas-Meseguer, Chief Strategy Officer, KINTO USA
How Maropost helped Bikes Online expand into new markets
Founded in Sydney, Australia, Bikes Online is a direct-to-consumer online retailer of road bikes, mountain bikes, and bike gear.
Challenge
Bikes Online needed an effective, customisable fraud prevention system as well as solutions capable of supporting the company’s growth into new geographies.
Solution
Maropost provided a one-stop solution for inventory management, order management, and shipping labelling. They offer a seamless checkout and payment experience for customers with Stripe, resulting in faster checkout times and access to more payment methods.
Impact
Bikes Online has seen a 10x of its US business since launch, $40,000 uplift in accepted transactions per month, and $10,000 savings per month in fraud prevention costs in each market.
What surprised me most about Stripe and Maropost is the human connection. We’ve had the chance to work with a highly engaged team that is passionate about building our business and helping solve problems quickly.
Jonathon Allara, Cofounder and Co-CEO, Bikes Online

How Slalom accelerated its Stripe practice at repeatable scale
Slalom is a global consulting firm focused on strategy, technology, and business transformation in 41 markets around the world.
Challenge
Slalom shared a goal to accelerate the development of its Stripe practice and arm its consultants with Stripe business solutions and technical expertise that would bring incremental value to customers. Slalom knew that building this on its own would require significant investment – so they looked to the Stripe Partner Ecosystem for support.
Solution
Slalom invested in its people to complete Stripe’s technical training and certifications, specifically designed for architects and developers, to provide them with real-world applications and implementation best practices from Stripe experts.
Impact
In just a few months, Slalom has trained over 26 of its implementation architects and engineers through Stripe’s training and certifications – efficiently enabling its teams to become productive and revenue generating.
The relationships that we have forged between our two teams are meaningful and benefit us both as we continue to work together on transformative projects. We’ve identified our path to success as working with Stripe and building a lasting partnership.
TC Sutton, managing director at Slalom
How Woo partnered with Stripe to launch payments
WooCommerce is one of the most popular e-commerce platforms in the world, enabling WordPress businesses to sell and manage orders directly from their websites.
Challenge
As Woo prepared to launch its WooPayments brand, the company looked to Stripe for co-marketing guidance and resources to confidently market a payments solution that would resonate with its merchants.
Solution
Woo leveraged best practices from Stripe’s marketing toolkit and customised the messaging for its own channels. This saved the team hours from creating content and strategy, allowing them to execute these campaigns and see results quickly.
Impact
Woo launched its payments product to 18 countries in just three months – and with a team of fewer than 20 people.
With anything related to Woo and Stripe, our approach to marketing is ‘all channels go.’ Stripe helps us position the different features and understand which channels are more advantageous, and it’s been inspiring to see the response from the market.
Clara Lee, VP of product & operations at Woo
How aye4fin partnered with Stripe to gain strategic sales advantage

Solution
aye4fin combined its industry expertise and close partnership with Stripe to position itself as the best implementation and development provider for its client’s needs.
Impact
aye4fin won its client over and helped it to go live in just a few months. It continues to be a strategic thought partner to the client for ongoing support and customisation work.
Our goal as technology-agnostic experts is to always aim to identify the best-in-class solutions for our clients in order to provide them with positive commerce experiences. Stripe is providing leading-edge payment solutions with premium technological and customer-centric solutions.

Control how funds flow
Connect supports almost any type of money movement you can dream up. Pay out users quickly and reduce operational overhead with Connect’s global routing and payout engine. You can split funds between multiple users, instantly route payments across borders, and specify your earnings on each transaction.

Buyers transact with sellers, often unaware of the platform's existence. The platform may take fees from the transaction. Example: A buyer makes a purchase from a store that is built on Shopify’s platform.

Everyone says they have the best conversion rates, but it’s something else when you can actually prove it. Within a week of starting our A/B test we saw that Stripe Checkout consistently had conversion rates that were 8% higher—so we switched!
Anthony Doctolero, Founder and CEO

Before Stripe Checkout, it felt like we were expending wasteful energy reinventing the wheel. Not only is our conversion rate now higher than it was during our peak sign-up periods, but it also allowed us to significantly simplify our codebase!

Booksy switches to Stripe for faster payouts and omnichannel payments
Founded in Poland in 2015, Booksy is a leading appointment management platform for beauty and wellness providers, serving over 20 million customers to easily find and book services such as haircuts, manicures, and massages.
Challenge
Booksy was deeply embedded with a payment provider that wasn't meeting expectations, driving some businesses to less secure payment methods as a workaround. Booksy wanted a more robust omnichannel payment offering with a broader range of use cases to keep up with the evolving needs of its providers.
Solution
Stripe professional services helped Booksy replace its payment provider within five months, providing key business guidance and working closely with Booksy engineers, helping it achieve its vision of a complete payments platform where providers can manage payments entirely through their Booksy account. Booksy migrated tens of thousands of connected provider accounts to Stripe overnight with a 97% success rate.

Stripe professional services was a huge help in integrating with Stripe. And it went beyond just answering minor questions – it included a large range of services and constant consulting on new ideas. We talked through issues and received guidance on how to use different products. On a scale of one to 10, we’d give professional services an 11.

Lynk & Co partners with Stripe experts to create a hassle-free payment experience
Lynk & Co is a Swedish automobile company that makes driving easy by offering drivers flexible mobility options. Drivers can access vehicles through a subscription model, car-sharing, or by purchasing their own car. Lynk & Co provides various services to help drivers maintain their vehicles, such as insurance, maintenance, and more.
Challenge
Lynk & Co wanted a new payment provider to ensure compliance with the EU’s Payment Services Directive (PSD2) and provide a seamless payment experience to more effectively convert Lynk & Co’s riders and drivers.
Solution
Lynk & Co partnered with Stripe professional services for guidance to accelerate a complex Stripe Connect integration to power Lynk & Co’s PSD2-compliant payments platform. Lynk & Co’s car-sharing offering launched across all seven active markets in a single day. Six months following its launch, Lynk & Co saw increases across its major offerings: 53% for car borrowers, 45% for car sharers, and 49% for car-sharing bookings.

Carousell creates extensive fraud prevention process with Stripe experts
Carousell, which is part of Carousell Group, is the leading multicategory platform for second-hand goods in Southeast Asia. It’s on a mission to inspire the world to start selling and to make second-hand the first choice by simplifying peer-to-peer buying and selling.
Challenge
Following Carousell’s Stripe Connect implementation, its trust and safety team gathered data about its most common fraud attack vectors. Carousell created a strategy with Stripe professional services to combat fraud threats specific to its business to boost reaction time, improve customer experience, and further global expansion.
Solution
Through a 10-week fraud strategy advisory, Carousell worked with Stripe professional services to build and refine its trust and safety processes by creating user personas to identify its most significant threats, risks, and mitigation opportunities. After implementing the new fraud processes, Carousell has seen a reduction in detection and reaction times, as well as a 75% reduction in false positives, a 15% reduction in 3D Secure (3DS) interventions, a 10% increase in issuer authorisation rates, and reduced early payment blocks.

Togetherwork partners with Stripe experts to build a seamless experience for its customers
Togetherwork provides software and payments solutions to organisations to help build efficiencies and increase revenue. With a world-class approach to technology and operations, Togetherwork strives to deliver the best experiences to its customers and communities.
Challenge
As Togetherwork’s business rapidly expanded, it quickly started to outgrow its homegrown payments platform, which combined multiple processors. It needed a more modern payment solution to support its rapid growth and guidance on consolidating more than 20 processors across its portfolio of product lines.
Solution
Togetherwork turned to Stripe professional services to guide the implementation of a new scalable global payments platform. Implementation services helped Togetherwork consolidate more than 20 payment processors across more than 15 product lines, preparing the organisation for the new solution operationally. Advisory services helped Togetherwork bring new financial service offerings to market using Stripe banking-as-a-service products.

Our customers are building the future
Stripe builds financial infrastructure that ambitious companies use to launch their boldest products. Our customers range from hours-old startups to complex global businesses. Collectively, they are growing the GDP of the internet. You can help.

Impact
Who do you want to serve in your career?
Our customers operate in almost every industry and country. They feed communities, provide healthcare, and help people get around. They run shops, gyms, churches, and they build tools for helping others run them too. They’re selling from their front rooms, and managing global enterprises. And they rely on the infrastructure we build.
Stripe processed $641 billion in payments in 2021. We have been entrusted with a significant portion of the global economy, and we need to continue to be reliable stewards of that trust.
What matters to us is what we enable for others
We focus on the details of everything we do, so businesses around the world can focus on what’s most important to them. So Ford can focus on building a global digital dealership, rather than processing payments. So Le Monde can expand its digital offering globally, not reinvent subscription billing. So truckers can focus on getting supply chains moving, not invoicing paper trails. We take pride in freeing up others to work in the spotlight.

Challenges
Nothing worth doing is easy
The leaders in any field make their success look easy. But beneath the surface they’re in constant motion, critiquing their own performance, setting new goals, and continually reevaluating the most basic assumptions about how they approach their work. We’re still in the early stages of our growth and many of our biggest challenges lie ahead. You might think that Stripe has things figured out. While we’re proud of what we’ve built so far, we spend our time thinking about everything we haven’t done yet.
We have to be extremely selective in what we do
Planning means sacrifice: we have great ambitions but limited resources over short time horizons. We are happy that we can support more than 50 payment methods (and accelerate rollout of new ones), incorporate more than 20,000 startups, and galvanize responses to climate change. But every quarter there are many important projects we want to undertake, but can’t.

A guide to payment methods
Read on stripe.com 
Growth requires reinventing our technology
The stack that got us here won’t get us there. We are constantly retooling to keep more than 8,000 Stripes productive, stay resilient to risks, and provide category-leading products at payment volumes higher on any given day than they used to be over an entire year.

We know we need to know more
Every project exposes us to challenges that are beyond our current capabilities. This motivates us to bring in people like you – people who have knowledge and experiences we don’t, and who can quickly bring their talents to bear on hard problems. Stripe is not a pay-your-dues culture; we will train you quickly and then give you substantial responsibility. We often have surprisingly small teams accomplish strikingly important work.
The pace of change and velocity of the product force you to pick up new skills, experiment with new tactics, and walk in a variety of users’ shoes.
Krithika Muthukumar, Marketing
We need to balance speed with meticulousness
We have to be able to build things quickly to support the fastest growing startups and platforms in the world, while also being reliable, trustworthy, and sometimes profoundly boring. We need to get projects done today, while building infrastructure that the internet will rely upon for decades. We also need to balance an intense work environment against the need to support fulfilling and sustainable careers.

Experience
The right people don’t always think they’re right
Successful Stripes are rigorous thinkers who appreciate that things worth doing are rarely simple. We want people who are not afraid to be wrong, who can enthusiastically back proposals they initially opposed, and who know how to support decisions with numbers and narrative. We operate in situations of substantial uncertainty and cannot afford either timidity or recklessness.
The global financial system can seem like a mystifying domain. It is not. It is composed of people and computers, just like many other systems you’ve worked on. Most Stripes don’t have a background in finance, and they’ve thrived here because they bring fresh perspectives. We want generalists capable of parachuting anywhere into our operations, learning about a field they have never touched before, and executing competently in areas far outside their formal remit.
We also want specialists who are already experts and want to spend several years advancing the state of the art in their fields.
We know that we cannot be successful without nurturing the careers of both generalists and the experts. People who thrive in high-conflict work environments often do not enjoy the experience here. We try to embrace kindness while still encouraging Stripes to take measured risks and act boldly, even in the absence of consensus.
Worldview
Working for the world, across the world
Stripe is a team, not a place. We have two headquarters (San Francisco and Dublin), but we belong to the internet. We speak more than 30 languages with our customers and even more with our families.
Where we are
More than 8,000 Stripes build products and support our users from offices in Amsterdam, Bangalore, Barcelona, Berlin, Chicago, Dubai, Dublin, Hyderabad, London, Melbourne, Mexico City, New York, Paris, Prague, São Paulo, San Francisco, Singapore, Stockholm, Sydney, Tallinn, Tokyo, Toronto, Warsaw, and Zurich—as well as all the homes and coworking spaces of our remote colleagues.
Where we need to be
We aspire to make internet payments as ubiquitous and effortless as email. This isn’t simply a matter of ignoring borders; it also requires respectful dialogue with governments, embracing cultural differences, and building products that work in local contexts. That’s why we try to be physically close to our users, too. We want to share cabs with them in Singapore and buy food together in the darshinis of Bangalore.
Where we’re improving
We are grappling with the challenges of operating at an organisational scale that few tech companies reach. We care about our culture and want to preserve the important parts while evolving to meet the needs of new Stripes and our changing business context.
StripeSat
We continuously listen to our employees to understand where Stripe truly excels and listen for opportunities to further enhance the way we work as a company and as individuals.
Mission

Community
Support to do your best work
Many companies can offer you attractive benefits and compensation. We offer that plus something a bit rarer: the opportunity to work with speed and agility on a platform that has an impact across the entire internet.
Training and mentorship
When you start at Stripe you will go through at least two weeks of in-depth onboarding. We will pair you with experienced team members to show you the ropes. And then you learn by doing. It is common for Stripes to work on things outside their domain of expertise, so we encourage people to regularly attend hands-on classes led by internal and external experts on everything from Learning to Code to Thinking Like a Lawyer.

Heterogenous perspectives
Stripes come from all sorts of professional backgrounds like engineering, design, operations, consulting, government, finance, healthcare, and education. We strive for humility as individuals and as an organisation. We know that we can do great things alone, but even greater things together. We have a transparent internal culture. If you are curious about engineering, running startups, corporate strategy, or the global economy, you’ll have experts to learn from. And they’ll be eager to learn from you.
Ownership and impact
There is no magic to working with banking partners in Japan, moving billions of dollars around the world, or pushing the limits of browser animations on our product pages. We have smart people who sweat the details – who start with a blank screen, work until a product is ready, and polish until it is exceptional. You will be able to point to specific, high-impact things that didn’t exist until you created them.
Everyone at Stripe thinks about creating the best user experience first, then works backward from there.
Dave Wright, Design

Prohibited and Restricted Businesses
Last updated: February 2025
This update clarifies that Stripe supports fundraising for non-profits, charities, political organisations, and businesses. We still require pre-approval for fundraising platforms (see the FAQs for additional details). Equity crowdfunding and charity sweepstakes/raffles for the explicit purpose of fundraising are permitted in select jurisdictions. There are no changes to Stripe’s prohibition on fundraising in India and Thailand. We added more specificity related to stored value. Lastly, we amended our stance on dating and matchmaking to only prohibit these services when they are sexually oriented. Non-sexually oriented dating and matchmaking may be supported with approval. Nothing else in this document has changed.

If there are any changes to your personal and business information, you must notify Stripe immediately
Use of Stripe products to facilitate transactions on behalf of another undisclosed merchant or for products or services that weren't disclosed in the business's Stripe account application

Prohibitions for Stripe Issuing products
You must not use Stripe Issuing for the following activities.
Consumer use
Consumer use of Stripe Issuing is when an Issuing card is created to fully or partially enable payments for personal, family, or household use, including: 
Providing a payment method loaded with or that accesses consumer funds
Cards that disburse payroll or payouts
Any other uses that directly or indirectly enable payments using the consumer's funds
International use
When you sign up for Stripe Issuing, you share with Stripe the location of your business, the physical address of your beneficial owners, and the jurisdiction in which your business is registered. Stripe requires that the physical location of your business, its jurisdiction of registration, and the physical address of at least one of your beneficial owners all match. Furthermore, you must use Issuing cards primarily in the same jurisdiction.
Lending use
You can't use Stripe Issuing as a method to extend credit to your customers using your own funds, unless you have the appropriate licensing to do so and you have received express consent from Stripe to use Issuing for that purpose.  
Other abusive use
Any other abusive use of Stripe Issuing, including:
Using Issuing cards to abuse free-trial products at scale
Using Issuing cards to buy in-demand items or services with the sole intent to sell them for profit (for example, retail scalping)
Using Issuing cards for any other illegitimate purposes
Non-compliance
As a user of Stripe Issuing, you must comply with our US compliance guidelines (or see the EU- and UK-specific guidelines) and our compliance teams might ask you to update your marketing materials or aspects of your user experience. This helps to make sure that both you and Stripe continue to comply with federal, state or any equivalent local or country-specific laws and regulations that govern the use of these financial products. Failure to comply within the requested time frames might result in the closure of your Stripe account. 
Inactivity
If there is inactivity on all cards associated with an account for a period of 12 consecutive months, Stripe automatically closes your Issuing account.
Integration type
If you plan to enable your customers to use Stripe Issuing for purposes of creating cards for your customers' employees or contractors, you must implement Stripe Issuing on Connect (for example, if you're a platform that wants to enable your customers to create cards for their employees to use for business travel or marketing expenses, you must create a Connect account for each of your customers). Please consult Stripe if you have any questions regarding the correct integration type for your business.

Get started
Choose the solution that’s right for you
There are two ways to become an early buyer of carbon removal with Stripe Climate. All purchases are facilitated by Frontier, an advance market commitment to buy an initial $1B+ of permanent carbon removal by 2030.
Climate Commitments
In just a few clicks, direct a percentage of your revenue to help the earliest-stage carbon removal companies in Frontier’s portfolio get out of the lab and into the field. This is the right choice for businesses that (i) care primarily about catalysing the field and (ii) don’t need to buy a specific number of tons to meet a climate target.
Start now 
Climate Orders
Pre-order a specific number of tons via the Stripe Dashboard or API. Tons will be supplied from Frontier's offtake portfolio. This is the right choice for businesses that (i) need to buy a specific number of tons to meet a climate target or (ii) want to offer carbon removal to their own customers.

If you can make a multi-year, multi-million dollar commitment to buying carbon removal, consider joining Frontier as a member. You can also make a one-time contribution.
The case for funding carbon removal
Carbon removal is critical to counteract climate change
To prevent the most catastrophic effects of climate change, we should aim to limit global average temperature increase to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels, which corresponds to reducing global annual CO₂ emissions from about 40 gigatons per year as of 2018, to net zero by 2050.
To accomplish this, the world will likely need to both radically reduce the new emissions we put into the air, and remove carbon already in the atmosphere.
Limit global temperatures increase to:

Historical emissions via Global Carbon Project,1 "Current path" shows SSP4-6.0,2,3 removal pathways adapted from CICERO.4 For simplicity this chart only shows CO₂, though the modelled scenarios account for other greenhouse gas emissions, all of which will need to be reduced.
However, carbon removal is behind
Existing carbon removal solutions such as reforestation and soil carbon sequestration are important, but they alone are unlikely to scale to the size of the problem. New carbon removal technologies need to be developed – ones that have the potential to be high volume and low cost by 2050 – even if they aren’t yet mature.
Today, carbon removal solutions face a chicken-and-egg problem. As early technologies, they’re more expensive, so don’t attract a critical mass of customers. But without wider adoption, they can’t scale production to become cheaper.
Early adopters can change the course of carbon removal
Early purchasers can help new carbon removal technologies get down the cost curve and up the volume curve. Experience with manufacturing learning and experience curves has shown repeatedly that deployment and scale beget improvement, a phenomenon seen across DNA sequencing, hard drive capacity, and solar panels.
This thinking shaped Stripe’s initial purchases and ultimately led us to launch Frontier, an advance market commitment (AMC) to buy carbon removal. The goal is to send a strong demand signal to researchers, entrepreneurs, and investors that there is a growing market for these technologies. We’re optimistic that we can shift the trajectory of the industry and increase the likelihood the world has the portfolio of solutions needed to avoid the worst effects of climate change.

Phlair is using a process known as electrochemical pH-swing. Their system uses a solvent to capture CO₂ and an acid to release it. This approach is inspired by recent innovation in Proton Exchange Membrane fuel cells and electrolysers, making the process both cost-effective and energy-efficient. The CO₂ is then run through Paebbl’s mineralisation process for permanent storage in construction materials.

Offtake
Deep dive 
CO280 is retrofitting a pulp and paper (P&P) mill to capture and store CO₂ that was absorbed from the atmosphere in biomass (“biogenic CO₂""). Black liquor, a byproduct of the P&P process, is combusted in a recovery boiler to recycle chemicals and provide heat for the process. The team will install a CO₂ capture unit to separate out the biogenic CO₂ from the recovery boiler flue gas. The CO₂ is then compressed and transported to a nearby geologic sequestration site.

Biomass carbon removal and storage

Offtake
Deep dive 
CREW is building specialized reactors to enhance natural weathering. The container-based system creates optimised conditions to speed up the weathering of alkaline minerals, and the discharged water stores CO₂ from wastewater safely and permanently as bicarbonate ions in the ocean. CREW’s system makes measuring CO₂ removed easier and can react with CO₂ from a variety of sources, including direct air capture and biomass systems, to maximise scale.

Offtake

Terradot spreads crushed basalt rock onto acidic and nutrient-depleted agricultural soils in Brazil. The rock material absorbs CO₂ from the air and soil, turning it into a form that enters runoff and permanent storage in the ocean.
Pathway
Enhanced weathering
Track
Offtake
Deep dive 
CarbonRun enhances the natural ability of river currents to weather abundant, low-cost limestone and reduce river acidity levels. This benefits river ecosystems locally and enhances the rivers’ ability to capture CO₂ from the atmosphere. Rivers, which are natural carbon transport systems, then deliver CO₂ to the ocean for permanent storage in the form of bicarbonate.

Ocean alkalinity enhancement

280 Earth’s continuous direct air capture system is a flexible design built with commercially available components and can draw power from several sources, including electricity or industrial waste heat. The captured CO₂ stream is then stored permanently.

Automate data delivery at scale
Set up Stripe Data Pipeline in minutes and automatically receive your Stripe data and reports in your data storage destination on an ongoing basis – no code required.
Do more with your data
Create a single source of truth to speed up your financial close and access better insights. Identify your best performing payment methods, analyse fraud by location, and more.
Direct and secure integration
Send your Stripe data directly to your data warehouse or cloud storage without involving a third-party extract, transform, and load (ETL) pipeline.
Avoid data outages and delays
Offload ongoing maintenance with a pipeline that’s built into Stripe. No matter how much data you have, your data is always complete and accurate.
How it works
Set up your pipeline in minutes – no data engineering required
1
Select your data warehouse or cloud storage
Pick the data storage destination you would like to connect to Stripe.
Data Pipeline can connect directly to your Snowflake or Amazon Redshift account. It can also connect with cloud storage destinations. This allows you to send your data to a variety of additional warehouses, such as Google BigQuery, Databricks, and more.
2
Connect your account
Provide the account information associated with your data storage destination. Stripe shares your data using industry-leading security practices.
3
You’re ready
Once your historical data has loaded, new data will be regularly refreshed. Start querying your Stripe data and reports in your own data warehouse, or use the structured files exported to your cloud storage destination.

For data engineering
Save the time and resources required to build and maintain an API integration
Before switching to Data Pipeline, Stripe users spent multiple months and as much as $800,000 building their own API integrations to export their Stripe data. They also needed to consistently monitor and update their home-grown solutions to support transaction updates, new datasets, schema changes, and other challenges as their data volumes grew.

ChowNow uncovers new growth opportunities and payment insights
ChowNow is a commission-free online food ordering platform that helps over 20,000 independent restaurants sustainably grow their delivery and takeaway businesses.
Challenge
ChowNow wanted to better understand profitability, margin, and unit economics at both the customer and transaction levels without having to build an API integration or share its data with an ETL pipeline.
Solution
With Stripe Data Pipeline, ChowNow has a complete picture of its restaurant and diner customers – all in one place. It can easily identify who and how much it’s charging for subscriptions and food orders.
It can also provide new insights to its restaurants and improve its fraud detection by looking at fraud signals, such as chargebacks, by restaurant.
By breaking down net margin per restaurant, ChowNow could optimise pricing of its commission-free product and improve restaurant retention.
We can immediately query Stripe data with other business data and confidently pull valuable customer and revenue insights to make the best decisions for our product and users – without needing any engineering support.

Lime improves accuracy and speed of financial reconciliation
Lime, a global leader in micromobility, offers on-demand electric scooters and bikes to city dwellers in more than 100 countries.
Challenge
Lime used a third-party ETL pipeline to export Stripe data to its data warehouse and noticed that the exported data wasn’t always matching up with the data in Stripe. A data engineer would have to dive into the cause of each discrepancy, costing up to two hours of their time for each inconsistent transaction.
Solution
By adopting Stripe Data Pipeline, Lime saved weeks of engineering time because it did not have to build and maintain an API for every single Stripe data set. Out of the box, Lime was able to access its current Stripe data directly in its data warehouse. Lime’s finance team can now track refunds in near-real time, allowing them to confidently report on the company’s latest cash status. Lime’s fraud team is also benefiting from improved fraud models.
The data quality and data freshness of Stripe Data Pipeline are a departure from third-party ETL pipeline vendors. Data imported through Stripe Data Pipeline always matches our reports exactly.
Saket Rai, Senior Director, Head of Data, Lime

Why Stripe Tax
Don’t let taxes hold you back
Businesses are required to collect taxes in more than 130 countries and in most US states. Staying compliant can be challenging, especially as your business grows. Tax rules and rates change constantly, and they vary based on what and where you sell. If you ignore these complexities, you risk paying penalties and interest on top of uncollected taxes.
We built Stripe Tax to simplify tax compliance, so you can focus on scaling your business.
See why Stripe was named a Leader in the “IDC MarketScape: Worldwide SaaS and Cloud-Enabled SaaS Sales and Use Tax Automation Software for Small and Midmarket 2024 Vendor Assessment.”
How to stay ahead of global tax changes in 2024
Tax laws and regulations are rapidly evolving to keep pace with the shifting global economy. We analysed the latest global tax changes and trends and what they mean to your business. Get the report to help you stay ahead of tax compliance in 2024.

Last updated: January 16, 2024
This Privacy Policy includes important information about your personal data and we encourage you to read it carefully.
Welcome
We provide financial infrastructure for the internet. Individuals and businesses of all sizes use our technology and services to facilitate purchases, accept payments, send payouts, and manage online businesses.
This Privacy Policy (“Policy”) describes the Personal Data we collect, how we use and share it, along with details on how you can reach out to us with privacy-related inquiries. Additionally, the Policy outlines your rights as a data subject and choices you have, including the right to object to certain usages of your Personal Data by us. For further information about our privacy practices, including our Supplemental U.S. Notice, please refer to our Privacy Center.
In this Policy, “Stripe”, “we”, “our,” or “us” refers to the Stripe entity responsible for the collection, use, and handling of Personal Data as described in this document. Depending on your jurisdiction, the specific Stripe entity accountable for your Personal Data might vary. Learn More.
“Personal Data” refers to any information associated with an identified or identifiable individual, which can include data that you provide to us, and we collect about you during your interaction with our Services (such as device information, IP address, etc.).
“Services” refer to the products and services provided by Stripe under the Stripe Services Agreement and the Stripe Consumer Terms of Service. This may include devices and applications provided by Stripe. Our “Business Services” are services that we provide to entities (“Business Users”) that directly and indirectly provide us with “End Customer” Personal Data in connection with their own business operations and activities. Our “End User Services” are those that Stripe provides directly to individuals for their personal use. “Sites” refer to Stripe.com, Link.com, and other Stripe websites, apps, and online services. Collectively, we refer to Sites, Business Services, and End User Services as “Services.”
“Financial Partners” are financial institutions, banks, and other partners such as payment method acquirers, payout providers, and card networks that we partner with to provide the Services.
Depending on the context, “you” might be an End Customer, End User, Representative, or Visitor:
When you use an End User Service for personal use, such as signing up for Link, we refer to you as an “End User.”
When you do business with, or otherwise engage in a transaction with a Business User, such as buying a pair of shoes from a Business User using Stripe Checkout for payment processing, but are not directly transacting with Stripe, we refer to you as an “End Customer.”
When you are acting on behalf of an existing or potential Business User—perhaps as a company founder, account administrator for a Business User, or a recipient of an employee credit card from a Business User via Stripe Issuing—we categorize you as a “Representative.”
When you interact with Stripe by visiting a Site without being logged into a Stripe account, or when your interaction with Stripe does not involve you being an End User, End Customer, or Representative, you are considered a “Visitor.” For example, you are a Visitor when you send a message to Stripe asking for more information about our Services.
In this Policy, “Transaction Data” refers to data collected and used by Stripe to facilitate transactions you request. Some Transaction Data is Personal Data and may include: your name, email address, contact number, billing and shipping address, payment method information (like credit or debit card number, bank account details, or payment card image chosen by you), merchant and location details, amount and date of purchase, and in some instances, information about what was purchased.
Depending on the activity, Stripe assumes the role of a “data controller” and/or “data processor” (or “service provider”) based on the activity. For more details about our role, the specific Stripe entity responsible under this Policy, and our legal bases for processing your Personal Data, please visit our Privacy Center.

1. Personal Data we collect and how we use and share it
Our collection and use of Personal Data differs based on whether you are an End User, End Customer, Representative, or Visitor, and the specific Service being utilized. For example, if you're a sole proprietor who wants to use our Business Services, we may collect your Personal Data to onboard your business; at the same time, you might also be an End Customer if you've bought goods from another Business User utilizing our Services for payment processing. You could be an End User if you used our End User Service, such as Link, for those transactions.
1.1 End Users
We provide End User Services when we provide the Services directly to you for your personal use (e.g., Link). Additional details regarding our collection, usage, and sharing of End User Personal Data, including the legal bases we rely on for processing such data, can be found in our Privacy Center.
a. Personal Data we collect about End Users
Using Link or Connecting your bank account. Stripe offers a service called "Link," which allows you to store your payment methods with Stripe to conveniently use them across our Business Users. When you sign up for Link, you agree to store your Personal Data (such as name, contact information, payment method details) with Stripe. This will allow for a more streamlined purchasing experience when using Link in the future. If you choose to pay with Link, we will also collect Transaction Data associated with your transactions. Learn More.
Should you decide to share your bank account information (including to make payments using your bank account via Link) with us, Stripe will periodically collect and process your account information (such as bank account owner information, account balances, account number and details, account transactions, and, in some cases, log-in credentials). You can ask us to cease the collection of such data at any time. Learn More.
You may also choose to store your identity documents (such as your driver’s license) using Link and share the saved document with other Business Users in the future.
Paying Stripe. When you purchase goods or services directly from Stripe, we receive your Transaction Data. For instance, when you make a payment to Stripe Climate, we collect information about the transaction, as well as your contact and payment method details.
Identity/Verification Services. We offer an identity verification service that automates the comparison of your identity document (such as a driver’s license) with your image (such as a selfie). You can separately consent to us using your biometric data to enhance our verification technology, with the option to revoke your consent at any time. Learn More.
More. For further information about other types of Personal Data that we may collect about End Users, including about your online activity and your engagement with our End User Services, please see the More ways we collect, use, and share Personal Data section below.
b. How we use and share Personal Data of End Users
Services. We use and share your Personal Data to provide the End User Services to you, which includes support, personalization (such as language preferences and setting choices), and communication about our End User Services (such as communicating Policy updates and information about our Services). For example, Stripe may use cookies and similar technologies or the data you provide to our Business Users (such as when you input your email address on a Business User’s website) to recognize you and help you use Link when visiting our Business User’s website. Learn more about how we use cookies and similar technologies in Stripe’s Cookie Policy.
Our Business Users. When you use Link to make payments, we share your Transaction Data with the Business Users you choose to do business with. Learn More. Furthermore, when you opt to connect your bank account with Stripe, you can also direct Stripe to share your account information with Business Users you do business with. Please note that these Business Users have their own privacy policies, which should describe how they use the information shared with them.
Transactions. When you use Link to make payments, we use your Personal Data (such as name, contact information, payment method details) saved with us to complete transactions with Stripe Business Users. We provide such data to Business Users and others you do business with and process it as a Data Processor for those Business Users, as detailed in Section 1.2 of this Policy.
Fraud Detection and Loss Prevention. We use your Personal Data collected across our Services (such as Stripe Radar) to detect fraud and prevent financial losses for you, us, and our Business Users and Financial Partners, including detecting unauthorized purchases. We may provide Business Users and Financial Partners that utilize our fraud prevention-related Business Services with Personal Data about you (including your attempted transactions) so that they can assess the fraud or loss risk associated with the transaction. Learn more about how we may use technology to assess the fraud risk associated with an attempted transaction and what information we share with Business Users and Financial Partners here and here.
Advertising. We may use your Personal Data to assess your eligibility for, and offer you, other End User Services or promote existing End User Services. Where allowed by law (including with your opt-in consent where required), we use and share End User Personal Data with others so that we may market our End User Services to you, including through interest-based advertising. We do not transfer your Personal Data to third parties in exchange for payment, but we may provide your data to third party partners, such as advertising partners, analytics providers, and social networks, who assist us in advertising our Services to you. Learn more.
More. For further information about additional ways by which we may use and share End Users' Personal Data, please see the More ways we collect, use, and share Personal Data section below.
1.2 End Customers
Stripe provides various Business Services to our Business Users, which include in-person or online checkout payment processing or processing payouts for those Business Users. When acting as a service provider—also referred to as a data processor—for a Business User, we process End Customer Personal Data in accordance with our agreement with the Business User and the Business User's lawful instructions. This happens, for example, when we process a payment for a Business User because you purchased a product from them, or when the Business User asks us to send you funds.
Business Users are responsible for ensuring that the privacy rights of their End Customers are respected, including obtaining appropriate consents and making disclosures about their own data collection and use associated with their products and services. If you're an End Customer, please refer to the privacy policy of the Business User you're doing business with for its privacy practices, choices, and controls.
We provide more comprehensive information about our collection, use, and sharing of End Customer Personal Data in our Privacy Center, including the legal bases we rely on for processing your Personal Data.
a. Personal Data we collect about End Customers
Transaction Data. If you're an End Customer making payments to, receiving refunds from, initiating a purchase or donation, or otherwise transacting with our Business User, whether in-person or online, we receive your Transaction Data. We may also receive your transaction history with the Business User. Learn More. Additionally, we may collect information entered into a checkout form even if you opt not to complete the form or transact with the Business User. Learn More. A Business User who utilizes Stripe’s Terminal Service to provide its goods or services to End Customers may use the Terminal Service to collect End Customer Personal Data (like your name, email, phone number, address, signature, or age) in accordance with its own privacy policy.
Identity/Verification Information. Stripe provides a verification and fraud prevention Service that our Business Users can use to verify Personal Data about you, such as your authorization to use a particular payment method. During the process, you’d be asked to share with us certain Personal Data (like your government ID and selfie for biometric verification, Personal Data you input, or Personal Data that is apparent from the physical payment method like a credit card image). To protect against fraud and determine if somebody is trying to impersonate you, we may cross-verify this data with information about you that we've collected from Business Users, Financial Partners, business affiliates, identity verification services, publicly available sources, and other third party service providers and sources. Learn More.
More. For further information about other types of Personal Data that we may collect about End Customers, including about your online activity, please see the More ways we collect, use, and share Personal Data section below.
b. How we use and share Personal Data of End Customers
To provide our Business Services to our Business Users, we use and share End Customers' Personal Data with them. Where allowed, we also use End Customers' Personal Data for Stripe’s own purposes such as enhancing security, improving and offering our Business Services, and preventing fraud, loss, and other damages, as described further below.
Payment processing and accounting. We use your Transaction Data to deliver Payment-related Business Services to Business Users, including online payment transactions processing, sales tax calculation, invoice and bill handling, and helping them determine their revenue, settle their bills, and execute accounting tasks. Learn More. We may also use your Personal Data to provide and improve our Business Services.
During payment transactions, your Personal Data is shared with various entities in connection to your transaction. As a service provider or data processor, we share Personal Data to enable transactions as directed by Business Users. For instance, when you choose a payment method for your transaction, be it a credit card, debit card, Buy Now Pay Later, or direct debit, your payment method provider may receive your Transaction Data from transactions facilitated by Stripe. The Business User you choose to do business with also receives Transaction Data and might share the data with others. Please review their privacy policies for more information about how they use and share your Personal Data.
Financial services. Certain Business Users leverage our Services to offer financial services to you via Stripe or our Financial Partners. For example, a Business User may issue a card product with which you can purchase goods and services. Such cards could carry the brand of Stripe, the bank partner, and/or the Business User. In addition to any Transaction Data we may generate or receive when these cards are used for purchases, we also collect and utilize your Personal Data to provide and manage these products, including assisting our Business Users in preventing misuse of the cards. Please review the privacy policies of the Business User and, if applicable, our bank partners associated with the financial service (the brands of which may be shown on the card) for more information.
Identity/Verification services. We utilize Personal Data about your identity, including information provided by you and our service providers, to perform verification services for Stripe or for the Business Users that you are transacting with, to prevent fraud and enhance security. If you provide a selfie along with an image of your identity document, we may employ biometric technology to compare and calculate whether they match and verify your identity. Learn More.
Fraud detection and loss prevention. We use your Personal Data collected across our Services to detect and prevent losses for you, us, our Business Users, and Financial Partners. We may provide Business Users and Financial Partners using our fraud prevention-related Business Services with your Personal Data (including your attempted transactions) to help them assess the fraud or loss risk associated with the transaction. Learn more about how we may use technology to assess the fraud risk associated with an attempted transaction and what information we share with Business Users and Financial Partners here and here.
Our Business Users (and their authorized third parties). We share End Customers' Personal Data with their respective Business Users and parties directly authorized by those Business Users to receive such data. Here are common examples of such sharing:
When a Business User instructs Stripe to provide another Business User with access to its Stripe account, including data related to its End Customers, via Stripe Connect.
Sharing information that you have provided to us with a Business User so that we can send payments to you on behalf of that Business User.
Sharing information, documents, or images provided by an End Customer with a Business User when the latter uses Stripe Identity, our identity verification Service, to verify the identity of the End Customer. 
The Business Users you choose to do business with may further share your Personal Data with third parties (like additional third party service providers other than Stripe). Please review the Business User’s privacy policy for more information.
Advertising by Business Users. If you initiate a purchasing process with a Business User, the Business User receives your Personal Data from us in connection with our provision of Services even if you don't finish your purchase. The Business User may use your Personal Data to market and advertise their products or services, subject to the terms of their privacy policy. Please review the Business User’s privacy policy for more information, including your rights to stop their usage of your Personal Data for marketing purposes.
More. For further information about additional ways by which we may use and share  End Customers' Personal Data, please see the More ways we collect, use, and share Personal Data section below.
1.3 Representatives
We collect, use, and share Personal Data from Representatives of Business Users (for example, business owners) to provide our Business Services. For more information about how we collect, use, and share Personal Data from Representatives, as well as the legal bases we rely on for processing such Personal Data, please visit our Privacy Center.
a. Personal Data we collect about Representatives 
Registration and contact information. When you register for a Stripe account for a Business User (including incorporation of a Business), we collect your name and login credentials. If you register for or attend an event organized by Stripe or sign up to receive Stripe communications, we collect your registration and profile data. As a Representative, we may collect your Personal Data from third parties, including data providers, to advertise, market, and communicate with you as detailed further in the More ways we collect, use, and share Personal Data section below. We may also link a location with you to tailor the Services or information effectively to your needs. Learn More.
Identification Information. As a current or potential Business User, an owner of a Business User, or a shareholder, officer, or director of a Business User, we need your contact details, such as name, postal address, telephone number, and email address, to fulfill our Financial Partner and regulatory requirements, verify your identity, and prevent fraudulent activities and harm to the Stripe platform. We collect your Personal Data, such as ownership interest in the Business User, date of birth, government-issued identity documents, and associated identifiers, as well as any history of fraud or misuse, directly from you and/or from third parties such as credit bureaus and via the Services we provide. Learn More. You may also choose to provide us with bank account information.
More. For further information about other types of Personal Data that we may collect about Representatives, including your online activity, please see the More ways we collect, use, and share Personal Data section below.
b. How we use and share Personal Data of Representatives 
We typically use the Personal Data of Representatives to provide the Business Services to the corresponding Business Users. The ways we use and share this data are further described below.
Business Services. We use and share Representatives’ Personal Data with Business Users to provide the Services requested by you or the Business User you represent.
In some instances, we may have to submit your Personal Data to a government entity to provide our Business Services, for purposes such as the incorporation of a business, or calculating and paying applicable sales tax. For our tax-related Business Services, we may use your Personal Data to file taxes on behalf of the Business User you represent. For our Atlas business incorporation Services, we may use your Personal Data to submit forms to the IRS on your behalf and file documents with other government authorities, such as articles of incorporation in your state of incorporation.
We share Representatives’ Personal Data with parties specifically authorized by the corresponding Business User, such as Financial Partners servicing a financial product, or third party apps or services the Business User chooses to use alongside our Business Services. Here are common examples of such sharing:
Payment method providers, like Visa or WeChat Pay, require information about Business Users and their Representatives who accept their payment methods. This information is typically required during the onboarding process or for processing transactions for these Business Users. Learn More.
A Business User may authorize Stripe to share your Personal Data with other Business Users to facilitate the provision of Services through Stripe Connect.
The use of Personal Data by a third party authorized by a Business User is subject to the third party’s privacy policy.
If you are a Business User who has chosen a name that includes Personal Data (for example, a sole proprietorship or family name in a company name), we will use and share such information for the provision of our Services in the same way we do with any company name. This may include, for example, displaying it on receipts and other transaction-identifying descriptions.
Fraud detection and loss prevention. We use Representatives’ Personal Data to identify and manage risks that our Business Services might be used for fraudulent activities causing losses to Stripe, End Users, End Customers, Business Users, Financial Partners, and others. We also use information about you obtained from third parties like credit bureaus and from our Services to address such risks, including to identify patterns of misuse and monitor for terms of service violations. Stripe may share Representatives' Personal Data with Business Users, our Financial Partners, and third party service providers to verify the information provided by you and identify risk indicators. Learn More. We also use and share Representatives' Personal Data to conduct due diligence, including conducting anti-money laundering and sanctions screening in accordance with applicable law.
Advertising. Where allowed by applicable law, we use and share Representatives’ Personal Data with third parties so we can advertise and market our Services. Subject to applicable law, including any consent requirements, we may advertise through interest-based advertising and track the efficacy of such ads. See our Cookie Policy. We do not transfer your Personal Data to third parties in exchange for payment. However, we may provide your data to third party partners, like advertising partners, analytics providers, and social networks, who assist us in advertising our Services. Learn more. We may also use your Personal Data, including your Stripe account activity, to evaluate your eligibility for and offer you Business Services or promote existing Business Services. Learn more.
More. For further information about additional ways by which we may use and share Representatives’ Personal Data, please see the More ways we collect, use, and share Personal Data section below.

We collect and use Personal Data to help us identify and manage activities that could be fraudulent or harmful across our Services, enable our fraud detection Business Services, and secure our Services and transactions against unauthorized access, use, alteration or misappropriation of Personal Data, information, and funds. As part of the fraud prevention, detection, security monitoring, and compliance efforts for Stripe and its Business Users, we collect information from third parties (such as credit bureaus) and via the Services we offer. In some instances, we may also collect information about you directly from you, or from our Business Users, Financial Partners, and other third parties for the same purposes. Furthermore, to protect our Services, we may receive details such as IP addresses and other identifying data about potential security threats from third parties. Learn More. Such information helps us verify identities, conduct credit checks where lawfully permitted, and prevent fraud. Additionally, we might use technology to evaluate the potential risk of fraud associated with individuals seeking to procure our Business Services or arising from attempted transactions by an End Customer or End User with our Business Users or Financial Partners.
Compliance with Legal Obligations. We use Personal Data to meet our contractual and legal obligations related to anti-money laundering, Know-Your-Customer ("KYC") laws, anti-terrorism activities, safeguarding vulnerable customers, export control, and prohibition of doing business with restricted persons or in certain business fields, among other legal obligations. For example, we may monitor transaction patterns and other online signals and use those insights to identify fraud, money laundering, and other harmful activity that could affect Stripe, our Financial Partners, End Users, our Business Users and others. Learn More. Ensuring safety, security, and compliance for our Services is a key priority for us, and collecting and utilizing Personal Data is crucial to this effort.
Minors. Our Services are not directed to children under the age of 13, and we request that they do not provide Personal Data to seek Services directly from Stripe. In certain countries, we may impose higher age limits as required by applicable law.
c. Sharing of Personal Data. 
Besides the sharing of Personal Data described above, we share Personal Data in the ways listed below:
Stripe Affiliates. We share Personal Data with other Stripe-affiliated entities for purposes identified in this Policy.
Service Providers or Processors. In order to provide, communicate, market, and advertise our Services, we depend on service providers. These providers offer critical services spanning from providing cloud infrastructure, conducting analytics for the assessment of speed, accuracy, and/or security of our Services, verifying identities, to providing customer service and audit functions. We authorize these service providers to use or disclose the Personal Data we make available to them to perform services on our behalf and comply with relevant legal obligations. We mandate these service providers to contractually commit to ensuring the security and confidentiality of the Personal Data they process on our behalf. The majority of our service providers are based in the European Union, the United States of America, and India. Learn More.
Financial Partners. We share Personal Data with certain Financial Partners to provide Services to Business Users seeking such Services as well as offer certain Services in conjunction with these Financial Partners. For instance, we share certain Personal Data about Representatives, such as loan repayment data and contact information, with institutional investors who purchase or provide credit that's secured through the Capital loans we've extended to the Business Users they are associated with.
Others with Consent. In some situations, we may not offer a service, but instead refer you to others (like professional service firms that we partner with to deliver the Atlas Service). In these instances, we will disclose the identity of the third party and the information to be shared with them, and seek your consent to share the information.
Corporate Transactions. If we enter or intend to enter a transaction that modifies the structure of our business, such as a reorganization, merger, sale, joint venture, assignment, transfer, change of control, or other disposition of all or part of our business, assets, or stock, we may share Personal Data with third parties in connection with such transaction. Any other entity that buys us or part of our business will have the right to continue to use your Personal Data, but subject to the terms of this Policy.
Compliance and Harm Prevention. We share Personal Data when we believe it is necessary to comply with applicable law; to abide by rules imposed by Financial Partners in connection with the use of their payment method; enforce our contractual rights; secure and protect the Services, rights, privacy, safety, and property of Stripe, you, and others, including against malicious or fraudulent activity; and to respond to valid legal requests from courts, law enforcement agencies, regulatory agencies, and other public and government authorities, which may include authorities outside your country of residence.

Enable fraud monitoring, detection, and prevention activities; and
Comply with our tax, accounting, and financial reporting obligations, including when such retention is required by our contractual agreements with our Financial Partners (and where data retention is mandated by the payment methods you've used).
In cases where we keep your Personal Data, we do so in accordance with any limitation periods and record retention obligations imposed by applicable law. Learn More.

Stripe से सामान या सेवाओं के लिए पेमेंट प्रोसेस करने के लिए कहते हैं;
फ़ाइनेंशियल कनेक्शन्स का इस्तेमाल करके Stripe को बैंक अकाउंट की जानकारी प्रदान करते हैं
हम आपकी व्यक्तिगत जानकारी दूसरों से भी जमा करते हैं, जैसे सहयोगी कंपनियों या दूसरी कंपनियों से.
मैं पूरी शेयरिंग को सीमित क्यों नहीं कर सकता?
संघीय कानून आपको केवल निम्न की सीमा तय करने का अधिकार देता है
सहयोगी कंपनिय के रोज़मर्रा के बिज़नेस के उद्देश्यों के लिए शेयर करना - आपकी साख के बारे में जानकारी
सहयोगी कंपनियों को आपकी जानकारी का इस्तेमाल करके आपके लिए मार्केट तक ही सीमित करना
गैर-संबद्ध कंपनियों को आपके लिए मार्केट में शेयर करना.
राज्य के कानून और व्यक्तिगत कंपनियाँ शेयर करने को सीमित करने के लिए आपको अतिरिक्त अधिकार दे सकती हैं. राज्य कानून के तहत अपने अधिकारों पर और ज़्यादा जानकारी के लिए नीचे दूसरी ज़रूरी जानकारी सेक्शन देखें.
क्या होगा जब मैं किसी दूसरे व्यक्ति के साथ संयुक्त तरीके से बनाए गए अकाउंट के लिए शेयरिंग रोक देता हूँ?
आपकी पसंद आपके अकाउंट में मौजूद सभी लोगों पर लागू होगी.
परिभाषाएँ
सहयोगी

हमारे सहयोगियों में Stripe नाम के तहत काम करने वाली कंपनियाँ शामिल हैं, जैसे Stripe पेमेंट्स यूरोप, लिमिटेड और Stripe पेमेंट्स यूके लिमिटेड।
गैर-संबद्ध
कंपनियाँ आम ओनरशिप या कंट्रोल से जुड़ी नहीं हैं।  वे फ़ाइनेंशियल और गैर-फ़ाइनेंशियल कंपनियाँ हो सकती हैं।
जिन गैर-सहबद्धों के साथ हम व्यक्तिगत जानकारी शेयर करते हैं उनमें सर्विस प्रोवाइडर्स शामिल हैं जो हमारी ओर से सेवाएँ या कार्य करते हैं, बिज़नेस यूज़र्स जिनके साथ आप ट्रांज़ैक्शन करना चुनते हैं, पार्टनर्स जिनके साथ हम आपको सेवाएँ देने के लिए डेटा शेयर करते हैं, और एडवरटाइज़िंग पार्टनर्स, एनालिटिक्स प्रोवाइडर्स, और सोशल नेटवर्क, जो आपको हमारी सेवाओं को एडवरटाइज़ करने में मदद करते हैं।

API Reference 
The Stripe API is organized around REST. Our API has predictable resource-oriented URLs, accepts form-encoded request bodies, returns JSON-encoded responses, and uses standard HTTP response codes, authentication, and verbs.
You can use the Stripe API in test mode, which doesn’t affect your live data or interact with the banking networks. The API key you use to authenticate the request determines whether the request is live mode or test mode.
The Stripe API doesn’t support bulk updates. You can work on only one object per request.
The Stripe API differs for every account as we release new versions and tailor functionality. Log in to see docs with your test key and data.
Just getting started?
Check out our development quickstart guide.
Not a developer?
Use Stripe’s no-code options or apps from our partners to get started with Stripe and to do more with your Stripe account—no code required.
BASE URL
https://api.stripe.com
CLIENT LIBRARIES
Ruby
Python
PHP
Java
Node.js
Go
.NET
By default, the Stripe API Docs demonstrate using curl to interact with the API over HTTP. Select one of our official client libraries to see examples in code.
Authentication 
The Stripe API uses API keys to authenticate requests. You can view and manage your API keys in the Stripe Dashboard.
Test mode secret keys have the prefix sk_test_ and live mode secret keys have the prefix sk_live_. Alternatively, you can use restricted API keys for granular permissions.
Your API keys carry many privileges, so be sure to keep them secure! Do not share your secret API keys in publicly accessible areas such as GitHub, client-side code, and so forth.
All API requests must be made over HTTPS. Calls made over plain HTTP will fail. API requests without authentication will also fail.

# The colon prevents curl from asking for a password.
YOUR API KEY
A sample test API key is included in all the examples here, so you can test any example right away. Do not submit any personally identifiable information in requests made with this key.
To test requests using your account, replace the sample API key with your actual API key or sign in.
Connected Accounts 
To act as connected accounts, clients can issue requests using the Stripe-Account special header. Make sure that this header contains a Stripe account ID, which usually starts with the acct_ prefix.
The value is set per-request as shown in the adjacent code sample. Methods on the returned object reuse the same account ID.

Errors 
Stripe uses conventional HTTP response codes to indicate the success or failure of an API request. In general: Codes in the 2xx range indicate success. Codes in the 4xx range indicate an error that failed given the information provided (e.g., a required parameter was omitted, a charge failed, etc.). Codes in the 5xx range indicate an error with Stripe’s servers (these are rare).
Some 4xx errors that could be handled programmatically (e.g., a card is declined) include an error code that briefly explains the error reported.
Attributes
code
nullable string
For some errors that could be handled programmatically, a short string indicating the error code reported.
decline_code
nullable string
For card errors resulting from a card issuer decline, a short string indicating the card issuer’s reason for the decline if they provide one.
message
nullable string
A human-readable message providing more details about the error. For card errors, these messages can be shown to your users.
param
nullable string
If the error is parameter-specific, the parameter related to the error. For example, you can use this to display a message near the correct form field.
payment_intent
nullable object
The PaymentIntent object for errors returned on a request involving a PaymentIntent.
type
enum
The type of error returned. One of api_error, card_error, idempotency_error, or invalid_request_error

HTTP STATUS CODE SUMMARY
200 OK Everything worked as expected.
400 Bad Request The request was unacceptable, often due to missing a required parameter.
401 Unauthorized No valid API key provided.
402 Request Failed The parameters were valid but the request failed.
403 Forbidden The API key doesn’t have permissions to perform the request.
404 Not Found The requested resource doesn’t exist.
409 Conflict The request conflicts with another request (perhaps due to using the same idempotent key).
429 Too Many Requests Too many requests hit the API too quickly. We recommend an exponential backoff of your requests.
500, 502, 503, 504 Server Errors Something went wrong on Stripe’s end. (These are rare.)
ERROR TYPES
api_error API errors cover any other type of problem (e.g., a temporary problem with Stripe’s servers), and are extremely uncommon.
card_error Card errors are the most common type of error you should expect to handle. They result when the user enters a card that can’t be charged for some reason.
idempotency_error Idempotency errors occur when an Idempotency-Key is re-used on a request that does not match the first request’s API endpoint and parameters.
invalid_request_error Invalid request errors arise when your request has invalid parameters.
Handling errors 
Our Client libraries raise exceptions for many reasons, such as a failed charge, invalid parameters, authentication errors, and network unavailability. We recommend writing code that gracefully handles all possible API exceptions.

# Select a client library to see examples of
# handling different kinds of errors.
Expanding Responses 
Many objects allow you to request additional information as an expanded response by using the expand request parameter. This parameter is available on all API requests, and applies to the response of that request only. You can expand responses in two ways.
In many cases, an object contains the ID of a related object in its response properties. For example, a Charge might have an associated Customer ID. You can expand these objects in line with the expand request parameter. The expandable label in this documentation indicates ID fields that you can expand into objects.
Some available fields aren’t included in the responses by default, such as the number and cvc fields for the Issuing Card object. You can request these fields as an expanded response by using the expand request parameter.
You can expand recursively by specifying nested fields after a dot (.). For example, requesting invoice.subscription on a charge expands the invoice property into a full Invoice object, then expands the subscription property on that invoice into a full Subscription object.
You can use the expand parameter on any endpoint that returns expandable fields, including list, create, and update endpoints.
Expansions on list requests start with the data property. For example, you can expand data.customers on a request to list charges and associated customers. Performing deep expansions on numerous list requests might result in slower processing times.
Expansions have a maximum depth of four levels (for example, the deepest expansion allowed when listing charges is data.invoice.subscription.default_source).
You can expand multiple objects at the same time by identifying multiple items in the expand array.

Idempotent requests 
The API supports idempotency for safely retrying requests without accidentally performing the same operation twice. When creating or updating an object, use an idempotency key. Then, if a connection error occurs, you can safely repeat the request without risk of creating a second object or performing the update twice.
To perform an idempotent request, provide an additional IdempotencyKey element to the request options.
Stripe’s idempotency works by saving the resulting status code and body of the first request made for any given idempotency key, regardless of whether it succeeds or fails. Subsequent requests with the same key return the same result, including 500 errors.
A client generates an idempotency key, which is a unique key that the server uses to recognize subsequent retries of the same request. How you create unique keys is up to you, but we suggest using V4 UUIDs, or another random string with enough entropy to avoid collisions. Idempotency keys are up to 255 characters long.
You can remove keys from the system automatically after they’re at least 24 hours old. We generate a new request if a key is reused after the original is pruned. The idempotency layer compares incoming parameters to those of the original request and errors if they’re the same to prevent accidental misuse.
We save results only after the execution of an endpoint begins. If incoming parameters fail validation, or the request conflicts with another request that’s executing concurrently, we don’t save the idempotent result because no API endpoint initiates the execution. You can retry these requests. Learn more about when you can retry idempotent requests.
All POST requests accept idempotency keys. Don’t send idempotency keys in GET and DELETE requests because it has no effect. These requests are idempotent by definition.

Metadata 
Updateable Stripe objects—including Account, Charge, Customer, PaymentIntent, Refund, Subscription, and Transfer have a metadata parameter. You can use this parameter to attach key-value data to these Stripe objects.
You can specify up to 50 keys, with key names up to 40 characters long and values up to 500 characters long. Keys and values are stored as strings and can contain any characters with one exception: you can’t use square brackets ([ and ]) in keys.
You can use metadata to store additional, structured information on an object. For example, you could store your user’s full name and corresponding unique identifier from your system on a Stripe Customer object. Stripe doesn’t use metadata—for example, we don’t use it to authorize or decline a charge and it won’t be seen by your users unless you choose to show it to them.
Some of the objects listed above also support a description parameter. You can use the description parameter to annotate a charge-for example, a human-readable description such as 2 shirts for test@example.com. Unlike metadata, description is a single string, which your users might see (for example, in email receipts Stripe sends on your behalf).
Don’t store any sensitive information (bank account numbers, card details, and so on) as metadata or in the description parameter.
Related guide: Metadata
Sample metadata use cases
Link IDs: Attach your system’s unique IDs to a Stripe object to simplify lookups. For example, add your order number to a charge, your user ID to a customer or recipient, or a unique receipt number to a transfer.
Refund papertrails: Store information about the reason for a refund and the individual responsible for its creation.
Customer details: Annotate a customer by storing an internal ID for your future use.

Pagination 
All top-level API resources have support for bulk fetches through “list” API methods. For example, you can list charges, list customers, and list invoices. These list API methods share a common structure and accept, at a minimum, the following three parameters: limit, starting_after, and ending_before.
Stripe’s list API methods use cursor-based pagination through the starting_after and ending_before parameters. Both parameters accept an existing object ID value (see below) and return objects in reverse chronological order. The ending_before parameter returns objects listed before the named object. The starting_after parameter returns objects listed after the named object. These parameters are mutually exclusive. You can use either the starting_after or ending_before parameter, but not both simultaneously.
Our client libraries offer auto-pagination helpers to traverse all pages of a list.
Parameters
limit
optional, default is 10
This specifies a limit on the number of objects to return, ranging between 1 and 100.
starting_after
optional object ID
A cursor to use in pagination. starting_after is an object ID that defines your place in the list. For example, if you make a list request and receive 100 objects, ending with obj_foo, your subsequent call can include starting_after=obj_foo to fetch the next page of the list.
ending_before
optional object ID
A cursor to use in pagination. ending_before is an object ID that defines your place in the list. For example, if you make a list request and receive 100 objects, starting with obj_bar, your subsequent call can include ending_before=obj_bar to fetch the previous page of the list.

Search 
Some top-level API resource have support for retrieval via “search” API methods. For example, you can search charges, search customers, and search subscriptions.
Stripe’s search API methods utilize cursor-based pagination via the page request parameter and next_page response parameter. For example, if you make a search request and receive "next_page": "pagination_key" in the response, your subsequent call can include page=pagination_key to fetch the next page of results.
Our client libraries offer auto-pagination helpers to easily traverse all pages of a search result.
Search request format

limit
optional
A limit on the number of objects returned. Limit can range between 1 and 100, and the default is 10.
page
optional
A cursor for pagination across multiple pages of results. Don’t include this parameter on the first call. Use the next_page value returned in a previous response to request subsequent results.
Search response format
object
string, value is "search_result"
A string describing the object type returned.

Versioning 
Each major release, such as Acacia, includes changes that aren’t backward-compatible with previous releases. Upgrading to a new major release can require updates to existing code. Each monthly release includes only backward-compatible changes, and uses the same name as the last major release. You can safely upgrade to a new monthly release without breaking any existing code. The current version is 2025-02-24.acacia. For information on all API versions, view our API changelog.
You can upgrade your API version in Workbench. As a precaution, use API versioning to test a new API version before committing to an upgrade.

Events 
Events are our way of letting you know when something interesting happens in your account. When an interesting event occurs, we create a new Event object. For example, when a charge succeeds, we create a charge.succeeded event, and when an invoice payment attempt fails, we create an invoice.payment_failed event. Certain API requests might create multiple events. For example, if you create a new subscription for a customer, you receive both a customer.subscription.created event and a charge.succeeded event.
Events occur when the state of another API resource changes. The event’s data field embeds the resource’s state at the time of the change. For example, a charge.succeeded event contains a charge, and an invoice.payment_failed event contains an invoice.
As with other API resources, you can use endpoints to retrieve an individual event or a list of events from the API. We also have a separate webhooks system for sending the Event objects directly to an endpoint on your server. You can manage webhooks in your account settings. Learn how to listen for events so that your integration can automatically trigger reactions.
When using Connect, you can also receive event notifications that occur in connected accounts. For these events, there’s an additional account attribute in the received Event object.
We only guarantee access to events through the Retrieve Event API for 30 days.

Setup Intents 
A SetupIntent guides you through the process of setting up and saving a customer’s payment credentials for future payments. For example, you can use a SetupIntent to set up and save your customer’s card without immediately collecting a payment. Later, you can use PaymentIntents to drive the payment flow.
Create a SetupIntent when you’re ready to collect your customer’s payment credentials. Don’t maintain long-lived, unconfirmed SetupIntents because they might not be valid. The SetupIntent transitions through multiple statuses as it guides you through the setup process.
Successful SetupIntents result in payment credentials that are optimized for future payments. For example, cardholders in certain regions might need to be run through Strong Customer Authentication during payment method collection to streamline later off-session payments. If you use the SetupIntent with a Customer, it automatically attaches the resulting payment method to that Customer after successful setup. We recommend using SetupIntents or setup_future_usage on PaymentIntents to save payment methods to prevent saving invalid or unoptimized payment methods.
By using SetupIntents, you can reduce friction for your customers, even as regulations change over time.

Tokens 
Tokenization is the process Stripe uses to collect sensitive card or bank account details, or personally identifiable information (PII), directly from your customers in a secure manner. A token representing this information is returned to your server to use. Use our recommended payments integrations to perform this process on the client-side. This guarantees that no sensitive card data touches your server, and allows your integration to operate in a PCI-compliant way.
If you can’t use client-side tokenization, you can also create tokens using the API with either your publishable or secret API key. If your integration uses this method, you’re responsible for any PCI compliance that it might require, and you must keep your secret API key safe. Unlike with client-side tokenization, your customer’s information isn’t sent directly to Stripe, so we can’t determine how it’s handled or stored.
You can’t store or use tokens more than once. To store card or bank account information for later use, create Customer objects or External accounts. Radar, our integrated solution for automatic fraud protection, performs best with integrations that use client-side tokenization.

There are two types of PaymentMethodConfigurations. Which is used depends on the charge type:
Direct configurations apply to payments created on your account, including Connect destination charges, Connect separate charges and transfers, and payments not involving Connect.
Child configurations apply to payments created on your connected accounts using direct charges, and charges with the on_behalf_of parameter.
Child configurations have a parent that sets default values and controls which settings connected accounts may override. You can specify a parent ID at payment time, and Stripe will automatically resolve the connected account’s associated child configuration. Parent configurations are managed in the dashboard and are not available in this API.

Prices 
Prices define the unit cost, currency, and (optional) billing cycle for both recurring and one-time purchases of products. Products help you track inventory or provisioning, and prices help you track payment terms. Different physical goods or levels of service should be represented by products, and pricing options should be represented by prices. This approach lets you change prices without having to change your provisioning scheme.
For example, you might have a single “gold” product that has prices for $10/month, $100/year, and €9 once.

SHOW
Invoices 
Invoices are statements of amounts owed by a customer, and are either generated one-off, or generated periodically from a subscription.
They contain invoice items, and proration adjustments that may be caused by subscription upgrades/downgrades (if necessary).
If your invoice is configured to be billed through automatic charges, Stripe automatically finalizes your invoice and attempts payment. Note that finalizing the invoice, when automatic, does not happen immediately as the invoice is created. Stripe waits until one hour after the last webhook was successfully sent (or the last webhook timed out after failing). If you (and the platforms you may have connected to) have no webhooks configured, Stripe waits one hour after creation to finalize the invoice.
If your invoice is configured to be billed by sending an email, then based on your email settings, Stripe will email the invoice to your customer and await payment. These emails can contain a link to a hosted page to pay the invoice.
Stripe applies any customer credit on the account before determining the amount due for the invoice (i.e., the amount that will be actually charged). If the amount due for the invoice is less than Stripe’s minimum allowed charge per currency, the invoice is automatically marked paid, and we add the amount due to the customer’s credit balance which is applied to the next invoice.
More details on the customer’s credit balance are here.

Invoice Items 
Invoice Items represent the component lines of an invoice. An invoice item is added to an invoice by creating or updating it with an invoice field, at which point it will be included as an invoice line item within invoice.lines.
Invoice Items can be created before you are ready to actually send the invoice. This can be particularly useful when combined with a subscription. Sometimes you want to add a charge or credit to a customer, but actually charge or credit the customer’s card only at the end of a regular billing cycle. This is useful for combining several charges (to minimize per-transaction fees), or for having Stripe tabulate your usage-based billing totals.

A platform cannot access a person for an account where account.controller.requirement_collection is stripe, which includes Standard and Express accounts, after creating an Account Link or Account Session to start Connect onboarding.
See the Standard onboarding or Express onboarding documentation for information about prefilling information and account onboarding steps. Learn more about handling identity verification with the API.

Transfers 
A Transfer object is created when you move funds between Stripe accounts as part of Connect.
Before April 6, 2017, transfers also represented movement of funds from a Stripe account to a card or bank account. This behavior has since been split out into a Payout object, with corresponding payout endpoints. For more information, read about the transfer/payout split.

Transfer Reversals 
Stripe Connect platforms can reverse transfers made to a connected account, either entirely or partially, and can also specify whether to refund any related application fees. Transfer reversals add to the platform’s balance and subtract from the destination account’s balance.
Reversing a transfer that was made for a destination charge is allowed only up to the amount of the charge. It is possible to reverse a transfer_group transfer only if the destination account has enough balance to cover the reversal.

Secrets 
Secret Store is an API that allows Stripe Apps developers to securely persist secrets for use by UI Extensions and app backends.
The primary resource in Secret Store is a secret. Other apps can’t view secrets created by an app. Additionally, secrets are scoped to provide further permission control.
All Dashboard users and the app backend share account scoped secrets. Use the account scope for secrets that don’t change per-user, like a third-party API key.
A user scoped secret is accessible by the app backend and one specific Dashboard user. Use the user scope for per-user secrets like per-user OAuth tokens, where different users might have different permissions.

Italic brings the luxury of one-click checkouts with Stripe
Italic offers unbranded, atelier-grade essentials produced using the same manufacturers and materials as top luxury houses, but without the markup.

Castlery uses Stripe to streamline operations
Castlery is a direct-to-consumer furniture brand that needed a partner to help them centralise purchases online and in-person across the globe.
Challenge
Castlery sold products both online and offline in physical showrooms. Transactions processed in-store required purchase information to be manually copied over into Castlery’s internal systems, which created unnecessary overhead for their team members.
Solution
Castlery migrated their entire payments system to Stripe. By having a unified view of their customers across channels, they were able to personalise support, speed up financial reconciliation, and accelerate their refund process from weeks to days.

Dermalogica uses Stripe to prevent fraud
Dermalogica is a professional skincare brand that needed help preventing fraudsters from making purchases without blocking legitimate customers.
Challenge
Skincare and cosmetic brands are often targets for fraud due to the high resale value of their products. In addition, Dermalogica’s mix of professional and consumer sales meant that a one-size-fits-all fraud solution would not work for them.
Solution
Dermalogica worked with Stripe to tailor fraud prevention to their unique customer base made up of both individual consumers and professional buyers with large order sizes. In just 6 months, they were able to cut fraud in half, while keeping the checkout experience smooth and frictionless for legitimate customers.

Waitrose uses Stripe to scale new services
Waitrose & Partners is a UK-based supermarket chain that needed help scaling their online ordering and delivery service.
Challenge
As the demand for online groceries grew rapidly due to lockdown measures in the UK, Waitrose needed help scaling quickly and ensuring that checkout was as user-friendly as possible.
