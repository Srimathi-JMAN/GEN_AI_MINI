Match typically paid out instantly on settlement of funds. Please see the IRS's IRA Deduction Limits for more information. You've got questions. We got answers. What's an IRA and how does it work? An individual retirement account (IRA) allows you to save and invest money for retirement with tax advantages. We offer 2 types of IRAs: Roth and traditional . A Roth IRA offers tax-free growth potential on after-tax contributions. With a traditional IRA, your investments have the opportunity to grow tax-deferred and you may be eligible for a tax deduction on your contributions. Each year, the IRS sets a maximum amount that you can contribute across all of your IRAs. This includes IRAs outside of Robinhood. For 2024 and 2025, the contribution limit is $7,000 for people under age 50, and $8,000 for people age 50 and over. Keep in mind, you can contribute to your IRA for the previous tax year until the IRS tax filing deadline. You can add money to your IRA in 2 ways: Make annual IRA contributions that count toward your limit. Transfer or roll over money from another retirement account. There is no limit to the amount you can transfer or roll over. When you fund a Robinhood IRA with Robinhood Gold, we’ll give you a 3% boost—also called a match—on all annual contributions. That means we’ll add 3% on top of every $1 you contribute—up to the IRS contribution limits. To earn a 3% boost, join Robinhood Gold for a monthly fee and keep your membership for 1 year**. Without Gold, you’ll still earn a 1% match on all annual contributions, IRA transfers, and old 401(k) rollovers. Disclosures: **1 year starts from the date of your first deposit that earned a Gold match. You must have earned (wage) income in order to contribute to an IRA. The funds that earned the match must be kept in the account for at least five years to avoid a potential Early IRA Match Removal Fee. For more information, visit the IRA Match FAQ . Funds being contributed into or distributed from retirement accounts may entail tax consequences. Contributions are limited and withdrawals before age 59½ may be subject to a penalty tax. Robinhood does not provide tax advice; please consult with a tax adviser if you have questions. The Robinhood IRA is available to any U.S. customer with a Robinhood brokerage account in good standing. All investments involve risk and loss of principal is possible. What's the IRA Match? The IRA match is a 3% match on annual contributions with a Robinhood Gold subscription ($5/month) or 1% without. You get matched on any amount from contributions, IRA transfers, or old 401(k)s. We’ll add 1%. No cap. All IRA transfers and old 401(k) rollovers earn 2% with Robinhood Gold until April 30th. Refer to Robinhood Gold IRA Transfers Match for more information. KEEP IN MIND The match isn’t counted toward your annual contribution limits. The IRA contribution limits set by the IRS for 2024 and 2025 are: $7,000 if you are under age 50, which means you can earn up to $70 extra (or $210 with Robinhood Gold). $8,000 if you are age 50 or over, which means you can earn up to $80 on top of your contributions (or $240 with Robinhood Gold). NOTE,
You can contribute to your IRA for the previous tax year until the IRS tax filing deadline. Read IRA match FAQs Disclosures: The funds that earned the match must be kept in the account for at least 5 years to avoid a potential Early IRA Match Removal Fee. For more information, visit Robinhood’s Help Center or FINRA’s site . This is not a recommendation to roll over. A rollover is not your only option for an old 401(k). You generally have 4 options for what you can do with a 401(k) from a former employer. There are pros and cons to each that you should consider. This isn’t tax advice. Consult a tax professional to understand your unique situation. For more information, visit Robinhood’s Help Center  or FINRA’s site. This is not a recommendation on any investment or investment strategy. When will I get the IRA Match? You’ll usually get your IRA match right away after your deposits settle. The exact amount of time depends on the type of deposit you’re making: If you’re making a regular annual contribution: Once your deposit is complete, you’ll usually get your IRA match money instantly. Keep your contributions in your IRA for at least 5 years to avoid the early IRA match removal fee. If you’re transferring an IRA: Once your transfer completes, your match amount is calculated based on the match percent of the total of the transferred cash plus transferred securities and options. Settlement happens when the securities are posted to the account and available to trade. Note that the match money is only available for securities that successfully transfer and settle and won’t be granted for securities that are rejected. If you’re rolling over a 401(k): When your old 401(k) rollover completes, the match will be calculated based on the match percent of total rollover amount. Read IRA match FAQs What's the difference between a Roth IRA and a traditional IRA? Each type of IRA has unique benefits. You can have a Roth or traditional IRA even if you already have a 401(k). With a Roth IRA: You’re only eligible to contribute to a Roth IRA if you make under a certain amount per year. You contribute after-tax dollars. This means your contributions aren’t tax-deductible. You can withdraw contributions anytime with no penalties or fees. If you withdraw earnings before you’re age 59½—and before you’ve owned your Roth IRA for at least 5 years—you may have to pay a 10% tax penalty. You aren’t required to make a withdrawal after you reach a certain age. Learn more about Roth IRAs With a traditional IRA: You generally contribute pre-tax dollars. This means you may be able to take a tax deduction for the amount you contribute—which could help you save on taxes each year. You can start withdrawing money without any penalties once you’re age 59½. You’re generally taxed on the amount you withdraw. If you need to make a withdrawal before you’re age 59½, you can—but you may have to pay a 10% penalty After you turn 73, you must withdraw a minimum amount each year from your traditional IRA to avoid tax penalties Learn more about traditional IRAs Disclosure: This is not investment or tax advice.

Yes, you can transfer another IRA or roll over old retirement accounts, like a 401(k) or 403(b), into a Robinhood IRA.

For example, you can transfer eligible assets from an outside Roth IRA into a Robinhood Roth IRA.

No, not the same. The Robinhood IRA match and employer 401(k) match both offer matches on contributions. They have the following differences: A 401(k) employer match is a contribution that an employer makes to an employee's retirement account. The Robinhood IRA is entirely different from your employer plan. The Robinhood IRA match is a percentage of your contribution amount, whereas a 401(k) match is generally a percentage of your compensation.  The percentage figure should not be used as a basis for comparison or evaluation. Your 401(k) may have a shorter vesting plan than the 5 year holding period required to earn the full Robinhood IRA match. Keep in mind that limitations apply to both types of retirement accounts. To learn more, read the IRS's IRA Deduction Limits . What are the tax advantages of investing in an IRA? We offer 2 types of IRAs: Roth and traditional . Each has special tax advantages. Roth IRA tax advantages: Although you contribute after-tax dollars, your potential IRA earnings grow tax-free because you pay taxes upfront. You won’t pay any taxes when you make qualified withdrawals as long you’re age 59½ and have had your IRA for 5 years. You should also know: Your contributions aren’t tax-deductible. If you withdraw any earnings before you’re age 59½ or before you’ve had account for 5 years, you’ll likely have to pay penalties and taxes. Traditional IRA tax advantages: You generally contribute pre-tax dollars. This means you may be able to take a tax deduction for the amount you contribute—which could help you save on taxes each year. Your contributions and any potential earnings grow tax-deferred—because you usually pay taxes once you start making withdrawals. You should also know: You’re required to withdraw a certain amount every year once you’re age 73, or else you may have to pay a penalty. If you (or your spouse, if you are married) are covered by a retirement plan through an employer, you may have to deduct less than you would otherwise. To learn more about the tax advantages of IRAs, visit the IRS website or talk to a tax advisor.

Robinhood Investor Index Robinhood Investor Index See how customers like you are investing. Updated Monthly
Last updated March 3, 2025 What is the Robinhood Investor Index? Robinhood Investor Index NASDAQ Past performance does not guarantee future results. Indices are not available for direct investment. Robinhood Investor Index tracks the performance of the top 100 most owned investments on Robinhood, in aggregate. The investments that make up the index are weighted by our customers’ conviction . Customer conviction is calculated from our customers' actual investments — the percentage of each investment in their portfolios. To ensure that all customers are equally represented , we calculate the average conviction for each investment across all our customers, whether they have $20 or $2 million - in their account. Learn more about the Robinhood Investor Index on our blog . We take the safeguarding of our customers' privacy seriously and will only publish index data in aggregate. We do not sell individual data about customer holdings to third parties. See disclosure for more details on how the index is calculated. The Robinhood Investor Index is made of stock and ADR holdings of customers with at least $20 of equity, with no maximum equity value.

It measures how investors are actually positioned. The Robinhood Investor Index does this by using data on the stock holdings/positions from our 20 million+ funded customer accounts. We do not include holdings in exchange traded funds (ETFs), options, penny stocks or crypto. To focus exclusively on actively acquired positions, we also exclude holdings in free stocks given to the customers by Robinhood. We include accounts that have been open for at least one month, with  a minimum equity value of $20, and no maximum value which enables us to broadly reflect our engaged customers according to our analysis. In our construction of the index, we utilize a proprietary method based on a relative allocation within each account. If customers have more of a particular stock in their accounts, the index holds more of that stock. Thus, each customer’s holdings, as a percentage of their total value in stocks, represents a contribution to  the percentage in the index.  In this way, everyone has the same influence. It's important to note that the index does not reflect the positions or performance  of any one individual investor, but rather it is an aggregate view of what our customers are investing in on a relative basis. The index weights are re-calculated on a monthly basis, at the beginning of each new month, utilizing values on the last trading day of the previous month. These monthly updates will be published on the dedicated site within 5 trading days after the first trading day of each month. We utilize data beginning in January 2020 (the index’s inception date) to calculate the index. Statistical Information The Nasdaq Composite Index is a market capitalization-weighted index of more than 3,700 stocks listed on the Nasdaq stock exchange. The index is constructed on a modified capitalization methodology. This modified method uses individual weights of included items according to their market capitalization. The stocks that make up the Robinhood Investor Index are not the same as the ones in the NASDAQ Composite Index. Individuals cannot invest directly in any index. The top holdings in the Robinhood Investor Index are represented by circles that correlate to the weight of each investment. The top sectors list the top eight sectors based on methodology by FactSet Revere Business and Industry Classification System (RBICS) of the Robinhood Investor Index for the prior month. There may be less than eight listed if there are less than eight sectors with holdings during a month. Market capitalization evaluation is broken into three categories, large cap (greater than $10 billion), mid cap (between 2 and 10 billion) and small cap (between 300 million and 2 billion). The Robinhood Investor Index  does not include securities considered micro cap (below 300 million). Disclosures Content is intended for educational or informational purposes only.

Old-school US automakers tumbled on the imposition of tariffs, with those that sell a relatively elevated share of imported cars stateside (like General Motors GM $47.32 (-7.36%) ) doing far worse than those with more final assembly completed domestically (like Ford F $10.03 (-3.79%) ). Some automakers with elevated domestic production and less exposure to imported parts, like Rivian RIVN $12.93 (7.56%) and Tesla TSLA $273.11 (0.43%) , even benefited from their rivals’ woes . And rental car companies Hertz HTZ $4.27 (22.03%) and Avis CAR $74.30 (20.50%) boomed on the presumption that tariffs would hit auto production or raise prices (perhaps both!), lifting demand for rental cars that can be resold by these firms. Airlines like American Airlines AAL $11.15 (-2.67%) , Delta DAL $46.22 (-4.01%) , and United Airlines UAL $73.64 (-5.60%) all hit the skids amid fresh data showing a precipitous drop-off in cross-border flight bookings between Canada and the US. GameStop GME $22.51 (-22.13%) had its worst day since the June livestream hosted by Keith Gill (aka Roaring Kitty) after investors reacted poorly to its convertible note issuance , either facing massive dilution or a destruction in the option value that was assigned to its massive cash pile. Meanwhile, Dollar Tree DLTR $77.25 (11.21%) ’s divestment of Family Dollar continues to be enthusiastically well received by traders, with the stock up double digits to be the S&P 500’s best performer on the day. SoFi Technologies SOFI $12.10 (-6.69%) , a stock beloved by retail traders as of late , slumped. AMD AMD $106.08 (-3.22%) was a laggard in the semi space after Jefferies flagged a widening performance gap between it and Nvidia.

Shares of Petco WOOF $3.16 (31.56%) are up more than 28% Thursday, following the brick-and-mortar pet store chain ’ s earnings report after the bell on Wednesday. Investor excitement isn ’ t just about pet owner demand for uncomfortable photos of their dog with the Easter Bunny: Petco ’ s full year-earnings outlook of between $375 million and $390 million exceeded Wall Street ’ s expectations of $367 million. The chain, which hired a new CEO over the summer, said it will close 30 unprofitable stores this year — adding to last year ’ s count of 25 closures. As it sheds low-performing locations, Petco is boosting its e-commerce biz: the company announced a partnership with Uber Eats UBER $74.53 (0.93%) on Thursday, bringing all of its US locations to the delivery app. Rival Chewy CHWY $32.58 (-1.62%) also topped estimates when it reported this week , reaching $3.23 billion in revenue (easily outselling Petco, which scored $1.55 billion). Petco Surges as New CEO’s Store Closures Boosts Profitability The chain, which hired a new CEO over the summer, said it will close 30 unprofitable stores this year — adding to last year ’ s count of 25 closures.

The AI revenue race heats up: OpenAI expecting $12.7 billion this year; Anthropic cuts deal with Databricks Revenue projections are rosy, but companies are still burning huge piles of investor cash. Jon Keegan 13h Matt Phillips 13h SoFi stock drops for the third day in a row The sell-off in shares of the online financial services firm may reflect broader jitters about the economy and tariffs. Luke Kawa 14h Rivian’s made-in-the-USA production strategy is offering shelter from the auto stock sell-off As most major global automakers tumble under the weight of new US tariffs, Rivian RIVN $12.93 (7.56%) is riding high. Shares of the electric vehicle maker are up more than 6% on Thursday because the stated goal of these tariffs — to boost American auto production for national security concerns — is something that Rivian’s already done. Its output comes from a plant in Normal, Illinois, with plans to build another manufacturing facility in Georgia next year. Goldman Sachs analyst Mark Delaney suggested that companies like Rivian and Tesla TSLA $273.11 (0.43%) , which domestically manufacture the cars they sell in the US, would be less impacted by the levies. They might face challenges from increased taxes on imported parts, but they’ll avoid any pain when it comes to assembled vehicles, in contrast to other leading automakers . J.

Edward Moreno 15h Ferrari responds to US tariffs with up to 10% price hikes on some cars Ferrari RACE $432.70 (3.17%) said it would raise prices on some of its cars by up to 10% in response to auto tariffs being imposed by the Trump administration. The Italian carmaker said Thursday that it will keep prices flat for three models: the Ferrari 296, SF90, and Roma. All other models ordered after April 2 will be subject to the price hike. President Trump’s 25% tariffs on foreign vehicles are set to start April 3. The tariffs threaten European luxury car brands, which count on the US for a large chunk of their sales. Germany, home to Porsche POAHY $3.88 (-2.02%) and Mercedes-Benz MBGYY $15.19 (-1.36%) , exports more cars to the US than any other European country .

Rani Molla 16h 76% Max Knoblauch 16h The tariff back-and-forth between the US and Canada has tanked air travel between the two countries. According to aviation analytics firm OAG, cross-border passenger bookings for US-Canada flights between April and September are down between 71% and 76% from last year. Peak travel season, July through August, is seeing the biggest drop. In all, airlines have shed about 320,000 ticketed US-Canada seats through October. Shares of the big four airlines — Delta DAL $46.22 (-4.01%) , American Airlines AAL $11.15 (-2.67%) , United Airlines UAL $73.64 (-5.60%) , and Southwest LUV $33.90 (-1.35%) — are all down Thursday. More than 20 million Canadians visited the US last year, the top source of international visitors. Tariffs could hurt the Canadian dollar and make travel to the US more expensive for Canadians — and a 10% decline in Canadian travel could result in $2.1 billion in lost spending, according to the US Travel Association.

Tom Jones 18h Max Knoblauch 18h Why Trump’s auto tariffs are crushing GM but not Tesla President Trump announced plans to smack imported cars and car parts with a 25% tariff on April 3, and investors once again do not like it. Understandably, auto stock performance is revealing which carmakers’ US sales rely more on imports: GM GM $47.32 (-7.36%) was down as much as 8% Thursday, compared to Ford’s F $10.03 (-3.79%) 4% fall. The discrepancy is likely due to the fact that about half of GM’s US sales (46%) are imports, compared to just a fifth (21%) for Ford. On the other hand, Tesla TSLA $273.11 (0.43%) manufactures its vehicles entirely in the US and only imports 20% to 25% of its parts from Mexico. Its shares are up over 5% as of 11:20 a.m. Thursday. Tariffs are widely expected to send auto costs surging for US consumers (up to $12,200 for some vehicles ). The United Auto Workers have praised the levies , saying they could bring thousands of manufacturing jobs back to the US.

Disclosures Get to know all the benefits of Gold How is Robinhood able to offer 9x the national savings average? How does it work? We're always looking for ways to help our customers make their money work for them. We leverage a network of partner banks to offer you a competitive APY on your uninvested cash. Once you have Gold, all you need to do is opt in to the brokerage cash sweep to have your uninvested brokerage account cash automatically “swept,” or moved, into deposit accounts at a network of program banks to earn interest. How can you give 10x the FDIC insurance of a standard bank's $250K? That's easy... we've got 12 partner banks so you can enjoy a combined coverage of up to $2.5 million FDIC insurance across all of them. How do I earn the 3% IRA Match and when is it paid out? You can earn the 3% match on all new IRA contributions, up to the contribution limit. The IRA Match will generally be available in your account and ready to invest when your deposits are completed. You must stay subscribed to Gold for one year and keep the assets in the IRA for five years in order to keep the full 3% match. See the IRA Match FAQ for more details about how it works. Is there a limit on how much interest I can earn? Nope! There is no cap or max on how much interest you can earn. Is it hard to withdraw my cash? How long does it take to get it out? It's your money, you can access your money whenever you want. Bank transfers can take up to 4-5 days or you can choose the instant withdrawal option for a 1.5% fee. How quickly can I move my money from earning interest to making an investment? Instantly! Your uninvested cash can be used to invest at any time to purchase assets in your brokerage account or IRA. How is this different from a savings account? Cash sweeps provide a way to ensure your money is not sitting idly in your brokerage account when it could be earning interest at a bank. With Robinhood Gold, your uninvested cash earns interest in bank deposit accounts at our network of partner banks. Interest is paid out monthly. How do I pay for Gold? Your brokerage account will be charged the monthly subscription fee every 30 days at the beginning of each billing cycle. Try Gold for free for your first 30 days.

Robinhood - Social Skip to main content Overview Environmental Social Governance Overview Environmental Social Governance Skip to main content Overview Environmental Social Governance Search query Search Social Robinhood is committed to breaking down barriers that have historically prevented millions of investors of all backgrounds and socioeconomic statuses from participating in the financial markets. Education We believe that offering educational resources is critical to advancing our mission. The more financial education people receive, the better equipped, and thus more empowered they will be to make personal investment decisions that meet their long-term goals. We offer a variety of ways for our customers to grow their financial knowledge: Robinhood Learn An online collection of feature tutorials and more designed to provide our customers with a breadth of financial education to learn and grow. In-app education Resources cover investing fundamentals, which allows customers to understand the basics of investing before making their first trade. Newsfeeds Our customers have access to free, premium news from sites such as Barron’s, Reuters, and Dow Jones. Sherwood Snacks Read the latest market-moving news without all of the complicated financial jargon. Community Engagement We live our values at Robinhood through meaningful community engagement and partnerships with mission-aligned organizations. Our work focuses on financial inclusion and financial education. Student-Athlete Financial Education We created Robinhood Money Drills, a first of its kind financial education program for students and student-athletes to develop the skills and confidence to manage their financial futures. This four-year program provides funding for financial education, including courses and speaker series, for students and student-athletes. Programs are in place at Coastal Carolina University, Duke University, Florida State University, Kansas State University, Texas Christian University, University of California Berkeley, University of Memphis, and West Virginia University. Teacher Training Robinhood partners with the Council on Economic Education and several of its state chapters, including Alabama, Delaware, Florida, Montana, and Nebraska. We hosted Family Financial Fun Nights to help train teachers how to educate their students on personal finance and aided schools to set up in-school savings programs. Retirement Education Workshops Robinhood developed a retirement education curriculum for independent workers, small business owners, and entrepreneurs. We established partnerships to serve distinct communities with this programming: Bunker Labs, an organization that supports entrepreneurs from the veteran and military spouse communities; the U.S. Black Chambers, Inc., known as the “National Voice of Black Businesses”; and Creative Ladder, a nonprofit that supports early- and mid-career creative professionals. Financial Inclusion Robinhood was founded on the belief that everyone should be able to participate in the financial markets, developing a platform with products that enable individuals to participate in our financial system regardless of wealth, income, or background. We engage in thoughtful partnerships with organizations who are similarly committed to financial inclusion such as the National Association of Securities Professionals, National Bankers Association, and Operation HOPE. “Operation HOPE remains committed to forging transformative partnerships with leading innovators, like Robinhood… Together, we can harness the power of innovation to empower individuals and communities with the knowledge and tools they need for a brighter, more financially secure future." John Hope Bryant, Founder, Chairman and CEO, Operation HOPE Growth, Motivation & Retention We strive to build an inclusive and equitable working environment for every single team member. To that end, we create the programs, tools, and resources that enable our employees to do their best work, lead exceptional teams, and realize their full potential. Our efforts include: Offering sessions for all employees on critical topics, including giving and receiving feedback, how to have meaningful performance conversations, and self-led career development, to name a few; Offering role-specific training, particularly for customer support associates and engineering roles; Offering a variety of formal and informal development opportunities to our managers; Coaching for our tenured leaders; and Providing opportunities to increase belonging, apply leadership skills, and drive
